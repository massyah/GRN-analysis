TI  - Dichotomous response to TGF-beta after TCR activation by naive CD4(+) T
      cells from DBA/1 mice: Enhanced RORgammat yet reduced Foxp3 expression.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To investigate the molecular mechanism for biased interleukin
      (IL-17) production by DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) and
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta stimulation. METHODS:: Purified
      naive CD4(+) T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 under Th1, Th2,
      Th17 and inducible T regulatory (iTreg) conditions. Cytokine production
      was assayed by intracellular staining and ELISA. Expression of
      transcription factors were determined by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and
      immunoblotting. RESULTS:: Naive CD4(+) T cells from DBA/1 mice produced
      more IL-17 under Th17 conditions compared to C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice.
      Further investigation revealed no difference amongst strains in CD4(+) T
      cell survival, upstream TCR signaling and CD69 expression; phosphorylation
      of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 and
      expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 that positively or
      negatively regulate IL-17 production. However, DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells
      expressed increased levels of retinoic acid receptor related orphan
      nuclear receptor (ROR)-gammat. Furthermore, under iTreg polarizing
      condition, DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells showed a strikingly reduced Foxp3
      expression. When interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-4 were blocked, Foxp3
      expression increased but remained lower in DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells following
      exposure to TGF-beta compared to B6 CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, DBA/1 CD4(+)
      T cells showed reduced phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 in both Th17 and
      iTreg conditions. CONCLUSION:: These results indicate that naive DBA/1
      CD4(+) T cells have a dichotomous response to TGF-beta: enhanced RORgammat
      yet reduced Foxp3 up-regulation. This observation may help elucidate the
      branch point of TGF-beta signaling leading to skewed Th17, but reduced
      iTreg differentiation.

TI  - SOCS3 regulates graft-versus-host disease.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is the main intracellular
      regulator of signaling by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, an
      immune-modulatory cytokine used to mobilize stem cells for
      transplantation. We have therefore studied the contribution of SOCS3 to
      the spectrum of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem
      cell transplantation (SCT). Grafts from SOCS3(-/Deltavav) donor mice in
      which SOCS3 deficiency is restricted to the hematopoietic compartment had
      an augmented capacity to induce acute GVHD. With the use of
      SOCS3(-/DeltaLysM) and SOCS3(-/Deltalck) donors in which SOCS3 deficiency
      was restricted to the myeloid or T-cell lineage, respectively, we
      confirmed SOCS3 deficiency promoted acute GVHD mortality and
      histopathology within the gastrointestinal tract by effects solely within
      the donor T cell. SOCS3(-/Deltalck) donor T cells underwent enhanced
      alloantigen-dependent proliferation and generation of interleukin-10
      (IL-10), IL-17, and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) after SCT. The enhanced
      capacity of the SOCS3(-/Deltalck) donor T cell to induce acute GVHD was
      dependent on IFNgamma but independent of IL-10 or IL-17. Surprisingly,
      SOCS3(-/Deltalck) donor T cells also induced severe, transforming growth
      factor beta- and IFNgamma-dependent, sclerodermatous GVHD. Thus, the
      delivery of small molecule SOCS3 mimetics may prove to be useful for the
      inhibition of both acute and chronic GVHD.

TI  - IL-17 enhancement of the IL-6 signaling cascade in astrocytes.
PG  - 4898-906
AB  - Astrocytes have important physiological roles in CNS homeostasis and serve
      as a bridge between the CNS and immune system. IL-17 and IL-6 are
      important in many CNS disorders characterized by neuroinflammation. We
      examined the role of IL-17 on the IL-6 signaling cascade in primary
      astrocytes. IL-17 functioned in a synergistic manner with IL-6 to induce
      IL-6 expression in astrocytes. The synergistic effect involved numerous
      signaling pathways including NF-kappaB, JNK MAPK, and p38 MAPK. The
      NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor BAY-11, JNK inhibitor JNKi II, and p38
      inhibitor SB203580 suppressed the synergistic effect of IL-6 and IL-17 on
      IL-6 expression. IL-17 synergized with IL-6 to enhance the recruitment of
      activated NF-kappaB p65, c-Fos, c-Jun, and the histone acetyltransferases
      CREB-binding protein and p300 to the IL-6 promoter in vivo to induce IL-6
      transcription. This was accompanied by enhanced acetylation of histones H3
      and H4 on the IL-6 promoter. Moreover, we elucidated an important role for
      suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 in IL-17 enhancement of IL-6
      signaling in astrocytes. SOCS3 small interfering RNA knockdown and SOCS3
      deletion in astrocytes augmented the synergistic effect of IL-6 and IL-17
      due to an enhancement of activation of the NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways.
      These results indicate that astrocytes can serve as a target of Th17 cells
      and IL-17 in the CNS, and SOCS3 participates in IL-17 functions in the CNS
      as a negative feedback regulator.

TI  - Flt3-Ligand Decreases Th17 Cells and SOCS Proteins in the Lung of House
      Dust Mite-sensitized and Challenged Mice.
AB  - We previously reported that Flt3-L reversed airway hyper-responsiveness
      (AHR) and airway inflammation, increased the number of regulatory
      CD11c(high)CD8alpha(high)CD11b(low) dendritic cells and
      CD4+CD25+ICOS+Foxp3+IL-10+ T-regulatory cells in the lung of
      allergen-sensitized and challenged mice. In this study, we evaluated the
      effect of Flt3-L on Th17 cells and expression of SOCS proteins in the
      lungs of house dust mite (HDM)-sensitized and challenged mice. BALB/c mice
      were sensitized and challenged with HDM and AHR to methacholine was
      established. Mice were treated with Flt3-L (5 mug, i.p.) daily for 10
      days. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and TGF-beta in the BALF
      were examined by ELISA. Flt3-L treatment reversed existing AHR to
      methacholine and substantially decreased eosinophils, neutrophils, IL-5,
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and TGF-beta levels in the BALF. HDM-sensitized and
      challenged mice showed a significant increase in lung
      CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+CD25- T-cells with high expression of ROR-gammat
      transcripts. However, administration of Flt3-L substantially decreased the
      number of lung CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+CD25- T-cells with significantly decreased
      expression of ROR-gammat mRNA in these cells. HDM sensitization caused a
      significant increase in the expression of SOCS-1, -3 and -5 in the lung.
      Flt3-L treatment abolished the increase in SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 protein,
      whereas SOCS-5 expression was significantly reduced. These data suggest
      that the therapeutic effect of Flt3-L in reversing the hallmarks of
      allergic asthma in a mouse model is mediated by decreasing IL-6 and
      TGF-beta levels in the BALF, which in turn decrease
      CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+ROR-gammat+CD25- T-cells and the expression of SOCS-1 and
      SOCS-3 in the lung of HDM-sensitized and challenged mice.

TI  - Loss of SOCS3 expression in T cells reveals a regulatory role for
      interleukin-17 in atherosclerosis.
PG  - 2067-77
AB  - Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory vascular disease responsible for the
      first cause of mortality worldwide. Recent studies have clearly
      highlighted the critical role of the immunoinflammatory balance in the
      modulation of disease development and progression. However, the
      immunoregulatory pathways that control atherosclerosis remain largely
      unknown. We show that loss of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3 in
      T cells increases both interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-10 production, induces
      an antiinflammatory macrophage phenotype, and leads to unexpected
      IL-17-dependent reduction in lesion development and vascular inflammation.
      In vivo administration of IL-17 reduces endothelial vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1 expression and vascular T cell infiltration, and significantly
      limits atherosclerotic lesion development. In contrast, overexpression of
      SOCS3 in T cells reduces IL-17 and accelerates atherosclerosis. We also
      show that in human lesions, increased levels of signal transducer and
      activator of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation and IL-17 are
      associated with a stable plaque phenotype. These results identify novel
      SOCS3-controlled IL-17 regulatory pathways in atherosclerosis and may have
      important implications for the understanding of the increased
      susceptibility to vascular inflammation in patients with dominant-negative
      STAT3 mutations and defective Th17 cell differentiation.

TI  - Protein geranylgeranylation regulates the balance between Th17 cells and
      Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.
PG  - 679-89
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that statins, the inhibitors for
      3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway,
      exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. However, the immune modulatory effects
      of statins on the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells and their underlying
      mechanisms are still largely unknown. To address these issues, we examined
      the effect of simvastatin and inhibitors for protein farnesylation and
      geranylgeranylation on the differentiation of IL-17-producing T cells
      (T(h)17 cells) and Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T cells. Simvastatin inhibited the
      differentiation of T(h)17 cells through the inhibition of HMG-CoA
      reductase activity but enhanced the differentiation of Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T
      cells. Geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor, GGTI-298, but not
      farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FTI-277, mimicked the effects of
      simvastatin, indicating that the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation
      is responsible for the effects. Moreover, Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T cells
      developed in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta and GGTI-298
      functioned as regulatory T cells (Tregs) in in vitro T cell proliferation
      assay as well as in an autoimmune colitis model. Finally, GGTI-298 induced
      SOCS3 expression and inhibited IL-6-induced signal transducers and
      activators of transcription3 phosphorylation in CD4(+) T cells. Taken
      together, these results indicate that protein geranylgeranylation enhances
      the differentiation of T(h)17 cells and inhibits the differentiation of
      Foxp3(+) Tregs partly via the inhibition of SOCS3 expression.

TI  - Inhibition of monocyte-derived inflammatory cytokines by IL-25 occurs via
      p38 Map kinase-dependent induction of Socs-3.
PG  - 3512-9
AB  - IL-25, a member of the IL-17 cytokine family, is known to enhance Th2-like
      responses associated with increased serum levels of IgE, IgG1, IgA, blood
      eosinophilia, and eosinophilic infiltrates in various tissues. However,
      IL-25 also abrogates inflammatory responses driven by Th17 cells. However,
      the cell types that respond to IL-25 and the mechanisms by which IL-25
      differentially regulates immune reactions are not well explored. To
      identify potential targets of IL-25, we initially examined IL-25 receptor
      (IL-25R) in human peripheral blood cells. IL-25R was predominantly
      expressed by CD14(+) cells. We next assessed the functional role of IL-25
      in modulating the response of CD14(+) cells to various inflammatory
      signals. CD14(+) cells responded to IL-25 by down-regulating the synthesis
      of inflammatory cytokines induced by toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and
      inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of cytokine response by IL-25 occurred
      via a p38 Map kinase-driven Socs-3-dependent mechanism. In vivo, IL-25
      inhibited monocyte-derived cytokines and protected against LPS-induced
      lethal endotoxemia in mice. These data indicate that IL-25 is a negative
      regulator of monocyte proinflammatory cytokine responses, which may have
      therapeutic implications.

TI  - IRF4 is essential for IL-21-mediated induction, amplification, and
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype.
PG  - 20846-51
AB  - Differentiation of murine T-helper (Th) 17 cells is induced by antigenic
      stimulation and the sequential action of the cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and
      IL-23, along with TGFbeta. Current dogma proposes that IL-6 induces IL-21,
      which, in a STAT3-dependent manner, amplifies its own transcription,
      contributes to IL-17 production, and, moreover, promotes the expression of
      the IL-23 receptor. This, in turn, prepares cells for IL-23-mediated
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype. Here we demonstrate that these
      effects of IL-21 on Th17 differentiation are completely dependent on IFN
      regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). After culturing in the presence of IL-21 plus
      TGFbeta, IRF4-deficient (Irf4(-/-)) Th cells showed a profound intrinsic
      defect in IL-17 production and in the autocrine IL-21 loop. Likewise, the
      levels of IL-23 receptor and the lineage-specific orphan nuclear receptors
      RORalpha and RORgammat were diminished, whereas the T regulatory (Treg)
      transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) was strongly up-regulated,
      consistent with the reciprocal relationship between Th17 and Treg
      development. Despite this loss of IL-21 functions, IL-21-induced STAT3
      activation was unimpaired and induced normal Socs3 expression. Forced
      expression of Foxp3 in WT cells inhibited IL-21-mediated IL-17 production,
      suggesting that the increase in Foxp3 contributes to the Irf4(-/-)
      phenotype. Additionally, the low levels of RORalpha and RORgammat are also
      partially responsible, because simultaneous overexpression of both
      proteins restored IL-17 production in Irf4(-/-) cells to some extent.
      These data highlight IRF4 as a decisive factor during the IL-21-mediated
      steps of Th17 development by influencing the balance of Foxp3, RORalpha,
      and RORgammat.

TI  - Splenic suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 transgene expression affects T
      cell responses and prevents development of collagen-induced arthritis.
PG  - 3742-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family
      are key negative intracellular regulators of cytokine and growth factor
      responses, including those that regulate immune responses in autoimmune
      disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to
      investigate modulation of T cell immunity for the treatment of
      experimental arthritis, via enhanced expression of SOCS-3 in splenic
      antigen-presenting cells (APCs) obtained after intravenous injection of
      adenovirus encoding SOCS-3. METHODS: DBA/1 mice were immunized with type
      II collagen, and adenovirus vectors were administered by intravenous
      injection before the clinical onset of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
      Splenic cellular responses were analyzed by measuring cytokine production,
      using Luminex multi-analyte technology. Th cell populations were analyzed
      by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Systemic delivery of adenovirus encoding
      SOCS-3 resulted in enhanced transgene expression in splenic APCs, which
      led to decreased production of interleukin-23 (IL-23), IL-6, and tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, but significantly higher production of
      antiinflammatory IL-10, by these cells. Fluorescence-activated cell
      sorting analysis showed increased numbers of splenic CD4+ T cells after
      SOCS-3 treatment. In the presence of SOCS-3-transduced APCs, however,
      purified splenic CD3+ T cells showed reduced antigen-specific
      proliferation and a significant reduction in the production of
      interferon-gamma (-43%), IL-4 (-41%), and IL-17 (-70%). Interestingly, the
      altered splenic cellular responses were accompanied by a protective effect
      on CIA development, and histologic analysis of knee joints showed reduced
      joint inflammation and connective tissue destruction. CONCLUSION: This
      study demonstrates effective prevention of CIA after intravenously induced
      overexpression of SOCS-3; this is probably caused by the generation of
      tolerogenic APCs, which have an inhibitory effect on Th1, Th2, and
      especially, Th17 cell activity.

TI  - Simvastatin inhibits IL-17 secretion by targeting multiple
      IL-17-regulatory cytokines and by inhibiting the expression of IL-17
      transcription factor RORC in CD4+ lymphocytes.
PG  - 6988-96
AB  - Statins, extensively used as cholesterol-lowering agents, have recently
      been identified as immunomodulatory agents. This study investigated the
      statins' mechanisms that target the autoimmune response in humans, and
      evaluated their therapeutic potential in multiple sclerosis. Our results
      demonstrated statin-mediated increases in suppressor of cytokine secretion
      (SOCS) 3 and suppressor of cytokine secretion 7, which negatively regulate
      the STAT/JAK signal transduction pathway and IL-6 and IL-23 gene
      expression in monocytes. Simvastatin also induced IFN-gamma, IL-4, and
      IL-27 production in monocytes, which together inhibited IL-17
      transcription and secretion in CD4(+) T cells. IL-17-producing CD4(+)
      cells, referred to as Th17 cells, have recently been found to play a
      central role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Furthermore,
      simvastatin directly inhibited the expression of retinoic acid-related
      orphan nuclear hormone receptor C, a transcription factor that controls
      IL-17 production in CD4(+) T cells. This effect was reversed by mevalonic
      acid, a downstream metabolite of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase,
      confirming that simvastatin's specific effect is through the inhibition of
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. These results provide evidence
      for the novel immunomodulatory mechanisms of statins, which selectively
      target the regulation of cytokine transcription involved in the
      development of the human autoimmune response. Based on the described
      immunomodulatory mechanisms, good safety profile and oral bioavailability,
      statins represent a promising therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis
      and other chronic inflammatory diseases.

      with IL-23 and characterized by production of IL-17, the functions of

      pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases has been described.

TI  - Interleukin 27 negatively regulates the development of interleukin
      17-producing T helper cells during chronic inflammation of the central
      nervous system.
PG  - 937-45
AB  - Studies have focused on the events that influence the development of
      interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing T helper cells (T(H)-17 cells) associated
      with autoimmunity, such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis, but
      relatively little is known about the cytokines that antagonize T(H)-17
      cell effector responses. Here we show that IL-27 receptor-deficient mice
      chronically infected with Toxoplasma gondii developed severe
      neuroinflammation that was CD4+ T cell dependent and was associated with a
      prominent IL-17 response. In vitro, treatment of naive primary T cells
      with IL-27 suppressed the development T(H)-17 cells induced by IL-6 and
      transforming growth factor-beta, which was dependent on the intracellular
      signaling molecule STAT1 but was independent of inhibition of IL-6
      signaling mediated by the suppressor protein SOCS3. Thus IL-27, a potent
      inhibitor of T(H)-17 cell development, may be a useful target for treating
      inflammatory diseases mediated by these cells.

TI  - SOCS-3 negatively regulates innate and adaptive immune mechanisms in acute
      IL-1-dependent inflammatory arthritis.
PG  - 1571-81
AB  - RA is an autoimmune disease characterized by sustained imbalance between
      pro- and antiinflammatory immune mechanisms. The SOCS proteins are
      negative regulators of cytokine signaling, but to date there has been
      little information on their function in disease. The generation of
      Socs3(-/Delta vav) mice, which lack SOCS-3 in the hematopoietic and
      endothelial cell compartment, allowed us to explore the role of endogenous
      SOCS-3 during acute inflammatory arthritis. Joint inflammation in
      Socs3(-/Delta vav) mice was particularly severe and was characterized by
      increased numbers of neutrophils in the inflamed synovium, bone marrow,
      peripheral blood, and spleen. These features were most likely due to
      increased production of and enhanced responsiveness to G-CSF and IL-6
      during arthritis in these mice. Local osteoclast generation and bone
      destruction were also dramatically increased in the absence of SOCS-3, as
      was macrophage activation. Finally, SOCS-3 was found to negatively
      regulate CD4+ T lymphocyte activation, including production of the
      pleiotropic cytokine IL-17. The absence of SOCS-3 therefore had dramatic
      effects in this disease model, with a broader impact on cellular responses
      than SOCS-1 deficiency. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence
      that endogenous SOCS-3 is a critical negative regulator of multiple cell
      types orchestrating inflammatory joint disease.

TI  - Selective regulatory function of Socs3 in the formation of IL-17-secreting
      T cells.
PG  - 8137-42
AB  - Suppressor of cytokine signaling (Socs) 3 is a cytokine-inducible
      inhibitor with critical but selective cell-specific effects. We show that
      deficiency of Socs3 in T cells had minimal effects on differentiation of T
      cells to the T helper (Th) 1 or Th2 subsets; accordingly, Socs3 had no
      effect on IL-12-dependent signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (Stat) 4 phosphorylation or IL-4-dependent Stat6 phosphorylation. By
      contrast, Socs3 was found to be a major regulator of IL-23-mediated Stat3
      phosphorylation and Th17 generation, and Stat3 directly binds to the
      IL-17A and IL-17F promoters. <38>We conclude that Socs3 is an essential
      negative regulator of IL-23 signaling, inhibition of which constrains the
      generation of Th17 differentiation.
