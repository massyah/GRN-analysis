PG  - 231-4
AB  - A new lineage of effector CD4+ T cells characterized by production of interleukin
      (IL)-17, the T-helper-17 (T(H)17) lineage, was recently described based on
      developmental and functional features distinct from those of classical T(H)1 and 
      T(H)2 lineages. Like T(H)1 and T(H)2, T(H)17 cells almost certainly evolved to
      provide adaptive immunity tailored to specific classes of pathogens, such as
      extracellular bacteria. Aberrant T(H)17 responses have been implicated in a
      growing list of autoimmune disorders. T(H)17 development has been linked to
      IL-23, an IL-12 cytokine family member that shares with IL-12 a common subunit,
      IL-12p40 (ref. 8). The IL-23 and IL-12 receptors also share a subunit,
      IL-12Rbeta1, that pairs with unique, inducible components, IL-23R and
      IL-12Rbeta2, to confer receptor responsiveness. Here we identify transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as a cytokine critical for commitment to T(H)17
      development. TGF-beta acts to upregulate IL-23R expression, thereby conferring
      responsiveness to IL-23. Although dispensable for the development of
      IL-17-producing T cells in vitro and in vivo, IL-23 is required for host
      protection against a bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. The action of
      TGF-beta on naive T cells is antagonized by interferon-gamma and IL-4, thus with IL-1β
      providing a mechanism for divergence of the T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 lineages. and this is related to TGF-β2
