TI  - 5-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dimethoxy-4H-chromen-4-one
      (MSF-2) suppresses fMLP-mediated respiratory burst in human neutrophils by
      inhib-iting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity.
AB  - Respiratory burst mediates crucial bactericidal mechanism in neutrophils.
      However, undesirable respiratory burst leads to pathological inflammation
      and tissue damage. This study investigates the effect and the underlying
      mechanism of
      5-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dimethoxy-4H-chromen-4-one
      (MSF-2), a lignan extracted from the fruit of Melicope Semecarprifolia, on
      fMLP-induced respiratory burst in human neutrophils and suggests a
      possible thera-peutic approach to ameliorate disease associated with
      neutrophil hyperactivation. MSF-2 inhibited fMLP-induced neutrophil
      superoxide anion production, cathepsin G release and migration in human
      neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers, reflecting inhibition of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. Specifically, PI3K/AKT
      activation results in migration, degranulation and superoxide anion
      production in neu-trophils. MSF-2 suppresses PI3K activation and
      phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) production, and
      consequently inhibits downstream activa-tion of PDK1 and AKT. Further,
      PI3K also stimulates respiratory burst via PLC-dependent elevation of
      intracellular calcium. MSF-2 reduces fMLP-mediated PLCgamma2 activation
      and intracellular calcium accumulation notably through extracellular
      calcium influx in a PI3K and PLC-dependent manner. However, MSF-2 is not a
      com-petitive or allosteric antagonist of fMLP. Additionally, in an in vivo
      study, MSF-2 prevents fMLP-induced neutrophil infiltration and
      inflammation in mice. In conclusion, MSF-2 opposes fMLP-mediated
      neutrophil activation and inflammation by inhibiting PI3K activation and
      subsequent activation of AKT and PLCgamma2. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Regulation of PTEN stability and activity by PLK3.
AB  - By studying primary isogenic murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we have
      shown that PLK3 null MEFs contain a reduced level of PTEN and increased
      Akt1 activation coupled with decreased GSK3beta activation under normoxia
      and hypoxia. Purified recombinant Plk3, but not a kinase-defective mutant,
      efficiently phosphorylates PTEN in vitro. Mass spectrometry identifies
      threonine 366 and serine 370 as two putative residues that are
      phosphorylated by Plk3. Immunoblotting using a phospho-specific antibody
      confirms these sites as Plk3-phosphorylation sites. Moreover, treatment of
      MEFs with LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3beta and CK2, only partially
      suppresses the phosphorylation, suggesting Plk3 as an additional kinase
      that phosphorylates these sites in vivo. Plk3-targeting mutants of PTEN
      are expressed at a reduced level in comparison with the wild-type
      counterpart, which is associated with an enhanced activity of PDK1, an
      upstream activator of Akt1. Furthermore, the reduced level of PTEN in PLK3
      null MEFs is stabilized by treatment with MG132, a proteosome inhibitor.
      Combined, our study identifies Plk3 as a new player in the regulation of
      the PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling axis by phosphorylation and stabilization of
      PTEN.

TI  - Syndecan-1-dependent suppression of PDK1/Akt/bad signaling by
      docosahexaenoic acid induces apoptosis in prostate cancer.
PG  - 826-36
AB  - Evidence indicates that diets enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (n-3 PUFAs) reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but biochemical mechanisms
      are unclear. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a transmembrane heparan sulfate
      proteoglycan, supports the integrity of the epithelial compartment. In
      tumor cells of epithelial lineage, SDC-1 is generally downregulated. This
      may result in perturbation of homeostasis and lead to progression of
      malignancy. Our studies have shown that the n-3 PUFA species,
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), increases SDC-1 expression in prostate tissues
      of Pten knockout (Pten(P-/-)) mice/cells and human prostate cancer cells.
      We have now determined that DHA-mediated up-regulation of SDC-1 induces
      apoptosis. Bovine serum albumin-bound DHA and exogenous human recombinant
      SDC-1 ecotodomain were delivered to PC3 and LNCaP cells in the presence or
      absence of SDC-1 small interfering (si)RNA. In the presence of control
      siRNA, both DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain induced apoptosis, whereas SDC-1
      silencing blocked DHA-induced but not SDC-1 ectodomain-induced apoptosis.
      Downstream effectors of SDC-1 signaling linked to n-3 PUFA-induced
      apoptosis involved the 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
      (PDK1)/Akt/Bad integrating network. A diet enriched in n-3 PUFA decreased
      phosphorylation of PDK1, Akt (T308), and Bad in prostates of Pten(P-/-)
      mice. Similar results were observed in human prostate cancer cells in
      response to DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain. The effect of DHA on PDK1/Akt/Bad
      signaling was abrogated by SDC-1 siRNA. These findings define a mechanism
      by which SDC-1-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of PDK1/Akt/Bad
      mediates n-3 PUFA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer.

TI  - Activation of Akt/mTOR pathway in a patient with atypical
      teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.
PG  - 185-9
AB  - A typical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant childhood
      brain tumor. Most AT/RTs are shown to contain chromosome 22 mutation in
      the region of hSNF5/INI1 gene, whose protein product participates in
      chromatin remodeling. Although the presence of this mutation is well
      described, molecular pathways underlying AT/RT development are poorly, if
      at all, understood. In the current paper we evaluate a case of AT/RT with
      special consideration of two pathways often implicated in tumor
      development: protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) and extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (Erk). First, we confirmed expression of typical
      protein pattern being unique for AT/RT, including epithelial membrane
      antigen, S-100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein. In molecular analyses
      we tested the sample for activity of Akt and Erk kinase cascade. We found
      that Erk pathway signaling in the tumor was not upregulated. Neither
      c-Raf, MAPK nor Erk were hyperphosphorylated. On the other hand, we
      detected significant phosphorylation of Akt, phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase-1 (PDK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). At the same time,
      inhibitor of Akt pathway, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), was not
      upregulated. These results strongly support the hypothesis that Akt
      pathway contributes to chromatin remodeling disruption, promoting
      malignant transformation of AT/RT.

TI  - Cystogenesis in ARPKD results from increased apoptosis in collecting duct
      epithelial cells of Pkhd1 mutant kidneys.
AB  - Mutations in the PKHD1 gene result in autosomal recessive polycystic
      kidney disease (ARPKD) in humans. To determine the molecular mechanism of
      the cystogenesis in ARPKD, we recently generated a mouse model for ARPKD
      that carries a targeted mutation in the mouse orthologue of human PKHD1.
      The homozygous mutant mice display hepatorenal cysts whose phenotypes are
      similar to those of human ARPKD patients. By littermates of this mouse, we
      developed two immortalized renal collecting duct cell lines with Pkhd1 and
      two without. Under nonpermissive culture conditions, the Pkhd1(-/-) renal
      cells displayed aberrant cell-cell contacts and tubulomorphogenesis. The
      Pkhd1(-/-) cells also showed significantly reduced cell proliferation and
      elevated apoptosis. To validate this finding in vivo, we examined
      proliferation and apoptosis in the kidneys of Pkhd1(-/-) mice and their
      wildtype littermates. Using proliferation (PCNA and Histone-3) and
      apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase-3) markers, similar results were obtained in
      the Pkhd1(-/-) kidney tissues as in the cells. To identify the molecular
      basis of these findings, we analyzed the effect of Pkhd1 loss on multiple
      putative signaling regulators. We demonstrated that the loss of Pkhd1
      disrupts multiple major phosphorylations of focal adhesion kinase (FAK),
      and these disruptions either inhibit the Ras/C-Raf pathways to suppress
      MEK/ERK activity and ultimately reduce cell proliferation, or suppress
      PDK1/AKT to upregulate Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 and promote apoptosis. Our
      findings indicate that apoptosis may be a major player in the cyst
      formation in ARPKD, which may lead to new therapeutic strategies for human
      ARPKD.

TI  - Resveratrol inhibits mTOR signaling by promoting the interaction between
      mTOR and DEPTOR.
AB  - Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenol that has been found
      to exert anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties.
      However, how RSV exerts its beneficial health effects remains largely
      unknown. Here we show that RSV inhibits insulin- and leucine-stimulated
      mTOR signaling in C2C12 fibroblasts via a Sirt1-independent mechanism.
      Treating C2C12 cells with RSV dramatically inhibited insulin-stimulated
      Akt, S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but had little effect on the tyrosine
      phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the activation of the p44/42
      MAP kinase signaling pathway. RSV treatment also partially blocked mTOR
      and S6K phosphorylation in TSC1/2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts
      (MEFs), suggesting the presence of an inhibitory site downstream of
      TSC1/2. Knocking out PDK1 or suppressing AMP-activated protein kinase had
      little effect on leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling. On the other hand, RSV
      significantly increased the association between mTOR and its inhibitor,
      DEPTOR. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated
      mTOR signaling was greatly reduced in cells in which the expression levels
      of DEPTOR were suppressed by RNAi. Taken together, our studies reveal that
      RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation by promoting mTOR/DEPTOR
      interaction and thus uncover a novel mechanism by which RSV negatively
      regulates mTOR activity.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of Sanguisorba officinalis ethanol extract on NO and
      PGE(2) production is mediated by suppression of NF-kappaB and AP-1
      activation signaling cascade.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Sanguisorba officinalis, a well known valuable medicinal
      plant in Korea, China and Japan used traditionally for the treatment of
      inflammatory and metabolic diseases such as diarrhea, chronic intestinal
      infections, duodenal ulcers, and bleeding. Recent studies have revealed
      that its aqueous or ethanolic extracts exhibit a variety of
      pharmacological activities such as anti-oxidative, anti-cancer, anti-lipid
      peroxidation, anti-atherogenic, and vasorelaxant effects. Systematic
      studies on the anti-inflammatory effect of this plant and its molecular
      mechanisms have not yet been fully investigated. Ethanol extract of
      Sanguisorba officinalis (So-EE) the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated
      macrophages and production of inflammatory mediators were employed to
      assess these properties. RESULTS: So-EE significantly suppressed the
      production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) E(2) from
      LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages in a
      dose-dependent manner. This extract effectively diminished the mRNA levels
      of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, implying that
      the blockade is generated at the transcriptional level. So-EE strongly
      blocked the activation and translocation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 by
      suppressing the upstream kinases including inhibitor of kappaBalpha
      (IkappaBalpha), IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK), Akt (protein kinase B),
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), p85/phosphoinositide-3-kinase
      (PI3K), and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) such as extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
      Moreover, So-EE suppressed the phosphorylation of Src, its kinase
      activity, and complex formation between Src and p85. CONCLUSION: This
      study suggests that So-EE has a potent anti-inflammatory activity mediated
      by NF-kappaB, and AP-1 inhibitory properties linked to the suppression of
      Src and MAPK activation.

TI  - Deletion of Akt1 causes heart defects and abnormal cardiomyocyte
      proliferation.
PG  - 384-91
AB  - The PI3K-PDK1-PKB/Akt (PI3K, phosphoinositide-3 kinase; PDK1,
      phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; PKB, protein kinase B)
      signaling pathway plays a critical role in a variety of biological
      processes including cell survival, growth and proliferation, metabolism
      and organogenesis. Previously, we generated Akt1-deficient mice and found
      high neonatal mortality with unknown causes. Here we report that
      histological analysis of Akt1-deficient embryos and newborns revealed
      heart defects and decreased cell proliferation. Echocardiographic study of
      Akt1-deficient mice indicated decreased heart function. Further
      investigation revealed that Akt1 deficiency caused substantial activation
      of p38MAPK in the heart. Breeding the Akt1-deficient mice to mice that
      were heterozygous for a null p38alpha partially rescued the heart defects,
      significantly decreased post-natal mortality, and restored normal patterns
      of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Our study suggests that Akt1 is essential
      for heart development and function, in part, through suppression of
      p38MAPK activation.

      study further characterized the molecular mechanisms of the anabolic
      actions of testosterone on a rat myoblast cell line (L6 cells).
      Testosterone did not induce hypertrophy in L6 cells lacking the androgen
      receptor (AR). Hypertrophy was prevented by the AR antagonist bicalutamide
      and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Testosterone induced Erk phosphorylation
      by 2h, and mTOR autophosphorylation was elevated within 20min;
      phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase was increased by 2h. Inhibitors of Erk or
      PI3K blocked tesotosterone-induced hypertrophy. Erk phosphorylation
      returned to baseline when media containing testosterone was replaced at
      16h with fresh media lacking testosterone; when bicalutamide was added to
      testosterone-enriched media at 16h, Erk phosphorylation remained elevated.
      Autophosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor was minimally altered by
      testosterone at 20min and unaffected at later time points;
      PI3K/PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Akt was not altered by
      testosterone. These findings indicate that testosterone stimulates
      hypertrophy of L6 myoblasts through a mechanism that requires its binding
      to the AR and involves a signaling cascade dependent upon Erk and mTOR
      which is likely activated by substances released into the extracellular
      space which are not IGF-1 or other ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases.

TI  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in thymocytes: the need for
      stringent control.
PG  - re5
AB  - The thymus serves as the primary site for the lifelong formation of new T
      lymphocytes; hence, it is essential for the maintenance of an effective
      immune system. Although thymocyte development has been widely studied, the
      mechanisms involved are incompletely defined. A comprehensive
      understanding of the molecular events that control regular thymocyte
      development will not only shed light on the physiological control of T
      cell differentiation but also probably provide insight into the
      pathophysiology of T cell immunodeficiencies, the molecular basis that
      underpins autoimmunity, and the mechanisms that instigate the formation of
      T cell lymphomas. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play a critical
      role in thymocyte development, although not all of their downstream
      mediators have yet been identified. Here, we discuss experimental evidence
      that argues for a critical role of the PI3K-phosphoinositide-dependent
      protein kinase (PDK1)-protein kinase B (PKB) signaling pathway in the
      development of both normal and malignant thymocytes, and we highlight
      molecules that can potentially be targeted therapeutically.

TI  - Heart 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activation by insulin requires PKB (protein
      kinase B), but not SGK3 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase
      3).
PG  - 267-75
AB  - On the basis of transfection experiments using a dominant-negative
      approach, our previous studies suggested that PKB (protein kinase B) was
      not involved in heart PFK-2 (6-phosphofructo2-kinase) activation by
      insulin. Therefore we first tested whether SGK3 (serum- and
      glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 3) might be involved in this effect.
      Treatment of recombinant heart PFK-2 with [gamma-32P]ATP and SGK3 in vitro
      led to PFK-2 activation and phosphorylation at Ser466 and Ser483. However,
      in HEK-293T cells [HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells expressing the
      large T-antigen of SV40 (simian virus 40)] co-transfected with SGK3 siRNA
      (small interfering RNA) and heart PFK-2, insulin-induced heart PFK-2
      activation was unaffected. The involvement of PKB in heart PFK-2
      activation by insulin was re-evaluated using different models: (i) hearts
      from transgenic mice with a muscle/heart-specific mutation in the PDK1
      (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1)-substrate-docking site
      injected with insulin; (ii) hearts from PKBbeta-deficient mice injected
      with insulin; (iii) freshly isolated rat cardiomyocytes and perfused
      hearts treated with the selective Akti-1/2 PKB inhibitor prior to insulin
      treatment; and (iv) HEK-293T cells co-transfected with heart PFK-2, and
      PKBalpha/beta siRNA or PKBalpha siRNA, incubated with insulin. Together,
      the results indicated that SGK3 is not required for insulin-induced PFK-2
      activation and that this effect is likely mediated by PKBalpha.

TI  - Pathway-based identification of biomarkers for targeted therapeutics:
      personalized oncology with PI3K pathway inhibitors.
PG  - 43ra55
AB  - Although we have made great progress in understanding the complex genetic
      alterations that underlie human cancer, it has proven difficult to
      identify which molecularly targeted therapeutics will benefit which
      patients. Drug-specific modulation of oncogenic signaling pathways in
      specific patient subpopulations can predict responsiveness to targeted
      therapy. Here, we report a pathway-based phosphoprofiling approach to
      identify and quantify clinically relevant, drug-specific biomarkers for
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors that target AKT,
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), and PI3K-mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR). We quantified 375 nonredundant PI3K pathway-relevant
      phosphopeptides, all containing AKT, PDK1, or mitogen-activated protein
      kinase substrate recognition motifs. Of these phosphopeptides, 71 were
      drug-regulated, 11 of them by all three inhibitors. Drug-modulated
      phosphoproteins were enriched for involvement in cytoskeletal
      reorganization (filamin, stathmin, dynamin, PAK4, and PTPN14), vesicle
      transport (LARP1, VPS13D, and SLC20A1), and protein translation (S6RP and
      PRAS40). We then generated phosphospecific antibodies against selected,
      drug-regulated phosphorylation sites that would be suitable as biomarker
      tools for PI3K pathway inhibitors. As proof of concept, we show clinical
      translation feasibility for an antibody against phospho-PRAS40(Thr246).
      Evaluation of binding of this antibody in human cancer cell lines, a PTEN
      (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10)-deficient
      mouse prostate tumor model, and triple-negative breast tumor tissues
      showed that phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) positively correlates with PI3K pathway
      activation and predicts AKT inhibitor sensitivity. In contrast to
      phosphorylation of AKT(Thr308), the phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) epitope is
      highly stable in tissue samples and thus is ideal for
      immunohistochemistry. In summary, our study illustrates a rational
      approach for discovery of drug-specific biomarkers toward development of
      patient-tailored treatments.

TI  - PDK1 recruitment to the SHPS-1 signaling complex enhances insulin-like
      growth factor-i-stimulated AKT activation and vascular smooth muscle cell
      survival.
PG  - 29416-24
AB  - In vascular smooth muscle cells, exposed to hyperglycemia and insulin-like
      growth factor-I (IGF-I), SHPS-1 functions as a scaffold protein, and a
      signaling complex is assembled that leads to AKT activation. However, the
      underlying mechanism by which formation of this complex activates the
      kinase that phosphorylates AKT (Thr(308)) is unknown. Therefore, we
      investigated the mechanism of PDK1 recruitment to the SHPS-1 signaling
      complex and the consequences of disrupting PDK1 recruitment for downstream
      signaling. Our results show that following IGF-I stimulation, PDK1 is
      recruited to SHPS-1, and its recruitment is mediated by Grb2, which
      associates with SHPS-1 via its interaction with Pyk2, a component of the
      SHPS-1-associated complex. A proline-rich sequence in PDK1 bound to an Src
      homology 3 domain in Grb2 in response to IGF-I. Disruption of Grb2-PDK1 by
      expression of either a Grb2 Src homology 3 domain or a PDK1 proline to
      alanine mutant inhibited PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1, leading to impaired
      IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr(308) phosphorylation. Following its recruitment
      to SHPS-1, PDK1 was further activated via Tyr(373/376) phosphorylation,
      and this was required for a maximal increase in PDK1 kinase activity and
      AKT-mediated FOXO3a Thr(32) phosphorylation. PDK1 recruitment was also
      required for IGF-I to prevent apoptosis that occurred in response to
      hyperglycemia. Assembly of the Grb2-PDK1 complex on SHPS-1 was specific
      for IGF-I signaling because inhibiting PDK1 recruitment to SHPS-1 had no
      effect on EGF-stimulated AKT Thr(308) phosphorylation. These findings
      reveal a novel mechanism for recruitment of PDK1 to the SHPS-1 signaling
      complex, which is required for IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr(308)
      phosphorylation and inhibition of apoptosis.

TI  - The human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein activates mTORC1 signaling
      and increases protein synthesis.
PG  - 9398-407
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase acts as a cellular
      rheostat that integrates signals from a variety of cellular signal
      transduction pathways that sense growth factor and nutrient availability
      as well as intracellular energy status. It was previously reported that
      the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 oncoprotein may activate the
      S6 protein kinase (S6K) through binding and E6AP-mediated degradation of
      the mTOR inhibitor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) (Z. Lu, X. Hu, Y.
      Li, L. Zheng, Y. Zhou, H. Jiang, T. Ning, Z. Basang, C. Zhang, and Y. Ke,
      J. Biol. Chem. 279:35664-35670, 2004; L. Zheng, H. Ding, Z. Lu, Y. Li, Y.
      Pan, T. Ning, and Y. Ke, Genes Cells 13:285-294, 2008). Our results
      confirmed that HPV16 E6 expression causes an increase in mTORC1 activity
      through enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and activation of downstream
      signaling pathways S6K and eukaryotic initiation factor binding protein 1
      (4E-BP1). However, we did not detect a decrease in TSC2 levels in HPV16
      E6-expressing cells. We discovered, however, that HPV16 E6 expression
      causes AKT activation through the upstream kinases PDK1 and mTORC2 under
      conditions of nutrient deprivation. We show that HPV16 E6 expression
      causes an increase in protein synthesis by enhancing translation
      initiation complex assembly at the 5' mRNA cap and an increase in
      cap-dependent translation. The increase in cap-dependent translation
      likely results from HPV16 E6-induced AKT/mTORC1 activation, as the
      assembly of the translation initiation complex and cap-dependent
      translation are rapamycin sensitive. Lastly, coexpression of the HPV16 E6
      and E7 oncoproteins does not affect HPV16 E6-induced activation of mTORC1
      and cap-dependent translation. HPV16 E6-mediated activation of mTORC1
      signaling and cap-dependent translation may be a mechanism to promote
      viral replication under conditions of limited nutrient supply in
      differentiated, HPV oncoprotein-expressing proliferating cells.

AB  - EGb 761 is an extract of Gingko biloba that exhibits neuroprotective
      effects against cerebral ischemia. The mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) is a critical downstream effector of Akt and a central regulator of
      ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. We investigated whether EGb
      761 regulates Akt downstream targets, including mTOR, p70S6 kinase, and S6
      phosphorylation. Adult male rats were treated with vehicle or EGb 761 (100
      mg/kg) prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Brains were
      collected at 24 hours after MCAO and the cerebral cortex regions were
      examined. We previously showed that EGb 761 significantly reduces infarct
      volume and decreases the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the cerebral
      cortex. Ischemic brain injury induces a decrease in Akt up-stream target,
      PDK1 phosphorylation. The levels of phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6 kinase,
      and phospho-S6 are subsequently decreased in regions affected by ischemic
      injury. However, EGb 761 prevented injury-induced decreases in these
      protein levels. We confirmed that EGb 761 inhibits injury-induced
      decreases in the number of positive cells for phospho-p70S6 kinase and
      phospho-S6. The results of this study provide evidence that EGb 761
      protects neuronal cells against ischemic brain injury by preventing
      injury-induced decreases in p70S6 kinase and S6 phosphorylation.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of liver regeneration and protection for treatment of
      liver dysfunction and diseases.
AB  - Liver regeneration is a necessary process that most liver damage depends
      on for recovery. Regeneration is achieved by a complex interactive network
      consisting of liver cells (hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, sinusoidal
      endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and stem cells) and
      extrahepatic organs (thyroid gland, adrenal gland, pancreas, duodenum, and
      autonomous nervous system). The restoration of liver volume depends on
      hepatocyte proliferation, which includes initiation, proliferation, and
      termination phases. Hepatocytes are "primed" mainly by Kupffer cells via
      cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and then "proliferation" and "cell growth"
      of hepatocytes are induced by the stimulations of cytokines and growth
      factors (HGF and TGF-alpha). Liver regeneration is achieved by cell
      proliferation and cell growth, where the IL-6/STAT3 and PI3-K/PDK1/Akt
      pathways play pivotal roles, respectively. IL-6/STAT3 pathway regulates
      hepatocyte proliferation via cyclin D1/p21 and protects against cell death
      by upregulating FLIP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Ref1, and MnSOD. PI3-K/PDK1/Akt is
      known to be responsible for regulation of cell size via its downstream
      molecules such as mTOR in addition to being known for its survival,
      anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties. Although the molecular
      mechanisms of liver regeneration have been actively studied, the
      mechanisms of liver regeneration must be elucidated and leveraged for the
      sufficient treatment of liver diseases.

TI  - Genetic alterations in the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway in
      thyroid cancer.
PG  - 697-706
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
      (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays a fundamental role in thyroid tumorigenesis,
      particularly in follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and aggressive thyroid
      cancer, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). As the drivers of this
      process, many genetic alterations activating the PI3K/Akt pathway have
      been identified in thyroid cancer in recent years. SUMMARY: This review
      summarizes the current knowledge on major genetic alterations in the
      PI3K/Akt pathway. These include PIK3CA mutations and genomic
      amplification/copy gain, Ras mutations, PTEN mutations, RET/PTC and
      PPARgamma/Pax8 rearrangements, as well as amplification/copy gain of
      PIK3CB, PDK1, Akt, and various receptor tyrosine kinase genes. Most of
      these genetic alterations are particularly common in FTC and many of them
      are even more common in ATC; they are generally less common in papillary
      thyroid cancer (PTC), in which the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway activated by
      the BRAF mutation instead plays a major role. Methylation and, thus,
      epigenetic silencing of PTEN, a major negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt
      pathway, occurs in close association with activating genetic alterations
      of the PI3K/Akt pathway, constituting a unique self-enhancement mechanism
      for this pathway. Many of these genetic alterations are mutually exclusive
      in differentiated thyroid tumors, but with increasing concurrence from
      benign tumors to FTC to ATC. RET/PTC, Ras, and receptor tyrosine kinase
      could dually activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Most cases of ATC
      harbor genetic alterations in these genes or other genetic combinations
      that can activate both pathways. It is proposed that genetic alterations
      in the PI3K/Akt pathway promote thyroid cell transformation to FTC and
      that genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway promote cell transformation
      to PTC; accumulation of multiple genetic alterations that can activate
      both pathways promotes thyroid cancer aggressiveness and progression to
      ATC. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations are common in the PI3K/Akt pathway
      in thyroid cancer and play a fundamental role in the tumorigenesis and
      progression of this cancer. This provides a strong basis for the emerging
      development of novel genetic-based diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic
      strategies for thyroid cancer.

TI  - Regulation of basal gastric acid secretion by the glycogen synthase kinase
      GSK3.
PG  - 1022-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to previous observations, basal gastric acid
      secretion is downregulated by phosphoinositol-3-(PI3)-kinase,
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1), and protein kinase B
      (PKBbeta/Akt2) signaling. PKB/Akt phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase
      GSK3. The present study explored whether PKB/Akt-dependent
      GSK3-phosphorylation modifies gastric acid secretion. METHODS: Utilizing
      2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5(6')-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)-fluorescence,
      basal gastric acid secretion was determined from Na(+)-independent pH
      recovery (pH/min) following an ammonium pulse, which reflects
      H(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity. Experiments were performed in gastric glands
      from gene-targeted mice (gsk3 ( KI )) with PKB/serum and
      glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK)-insensitive GSKalpha,beta, in which
      the serines within the PKB/SGK phosphorylation site were replaced by
      alanine (GSK3alpha(21A/21A), GSK3beta(9A/9A)). RESULTS: The cytosolic pH
      in isolated gastric glands was similar in gsk3 ( KI ) and their wild-type
      littermates (gsk3 ( WT )). However, pH/min was significantly larger in
      gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice and pH/min was virtually abolished by
      the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole (100 muM) in gastric glands from
      both gsk3 ( KI ) and gsk3 ( WT ). Plasma gastrin levels were lower in gsk3
      ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ). Both, an increase of extracellular K(+)
      concentration to 35 mM [replacing Na(+)/N-methyl-D: -glucamine (NMDG)] and
      treatment with forskolin (5 muM), significantly increased pH/min to
      virtually the same value in both genotypes. The protein kinase A (PKA)
      inhibitor H89 (150 nM) and the H(2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine (100
      muM) decreased pH/min in gsk3 ( KI ) but not gsk3 ( WT ) and again
      abrogated the differences between the genotypes. The protein abundance of
      phosphorylated but not of total PKA was significantly larger in gsk3 ( KI
      ) than in gsk3 ( WT ). CONCLUSIONS: Basal gastric acid secretion is
      enhanced by the disruption of PKB/SGK-dependent phosphorylation and the
      inhibition of GSK3. Thus, the inhibition of GSK3 participates in the
      signaling of PI3-kinase-dependent downregulation of basal gastric acid
      secretion.

TI  - PI3 kinase and PDK1 in the regulation of the electrogenic intestinal
      dipeptide transport.
PG  - 715-22
AB  - The phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and the phosphoinositide dependent
      kinase (PDK1) stimulate the serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase
      (SGK) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) isoforms, kinases stimulating a
      variety of transporters. Most recently, SGK1 was shown to stimulate the
      peptide transporters PepT1 and PepT2, and to mediate the glucocorticoid
      stimulation of PepT1. Basal electrogenic intestinal peptide transport was,
      however, not dependent on the presence of SGK1. The present study explored
      whether basal electrogenic intestinal peptide transport is dependent on
      PI3K or PDK1. To this end, peptide transport in intestinal segments was
      determined utilizing Ussing chamber analysis. Cytosolic pH (pH(i)) was
      determined by BCECF fluorescence. The luminal addition of 5 mM dipeptide
      gly-gly induced a current (Ip) across intestinal segments. Ip was
      significantly decreased in the presence of PI3 kinase inhibitors
      Wortmannin (1 microM) or LY294002 (50 microM). Exposure of isolated
      intestinal cells to 5 mM gly-gly was followed by cytosolic acidification
      (DeltapH(i)), which was significantly blunted by Wortmannin and by
      LY294002. Both, Ip and DeltapHi were significantly smaller in PDK1
      hypomorphic mice (pdk(1flfl)) than in their wild type littermates
      (pdk1(wt)). In conclusion, PI3K and PDK1 participate in the regulation of
      basal peptide transport.

TI  - Regulation of gastric acid secretion by PKB/Akt2.
PG  - 695-704
AB  - Pharmacological inhibition of phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and partial
      deficiency of phosphoinositide dependent kinase PDK1 have previously been
      shown to enhance basal gastric acid secretion. PI3K/PDK1 dependent
      signaling involves activation of protein kinase B/Akt, which may thus be
      similarly involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. To test
      that hypothesis, gastric acid secretion was determined in isolated glands
      from gene targeted mice lacking functional Akt2 (akt2(-/-)) or from their
      wild type littermates (akt2(+/+)). According to BCECF-fluorescence
      cytosolic pH in isolated gastric glands was similar in akt2(-/-) and
      akt2(+/+) mice. Na(+)-independent pH recovery (DeltapH/min) following an
      ammonium pulse, a measure of H(+)/K(+) ATPase activity, was, however,
      significantly faster in akt2(-/-) than in akt2(+/+) mice. In both
      genotypes, DeltapH/min was virtually abolished by H(+)/K(+) ATPase
      inhibitor omeprazole (100 muM). Increase of extracellular K(+)
      concentrations to 35 mM (replacing Na(+)) increased DeltapH/min to a
      significantly larger extent in akt2(+/+) than in akt2(-/-) mice and
      dissipated the differences between the genotypes. Similarly, treatment
      with 5 muM forskolin enhanced DeltapH/min significantly only in akt2(+/+)
      mice and abolished the differences between the genotypes. Conversely,
      protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (50 nM) decreased DeltapH/min to similarly
      low values in both genotypes. In conclusion, Akt2 suppresses gastric acid
      secretion and contributes to or even accounts for the inhibition of
      gastric acid secretion by PI3K.

TI  - PI3K/Akt-sensitive MEK-independent compensatory circuit of ERK activation
      in ER-positive PI3K-mutant T47D breast cancer cells.
PG  - 1369-78
AB  - We explored the crosstalk between cell survival (phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt) and mitogenic (Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) signaling pathways activated by an
      epidermal growth factor (EGF) and analyzed their sensitivity to small
      molecule inhibitors in the PI3K-mutant estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
      MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells. In contrast to MCF7 cells, ERK
      phosphorylation in T47D cells displayed resistance to MEK inhibition by
      several structurally different compounds, such as U0126, PD 098059 and PD
      198306, MEK suppression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and was also less
      sensitive to PI3K inhibition by wortmannin. Similar effect was observed in
      PI3K-wild type ER-positive BT-474 cells, albeit to a much lesser extent.
      MEK-independent ERK activation was induced only by ErbB receptor ligands
      and was resistant to inhibition of several kinases and phosphatases that
      are known to participate in the regulation of Ras/mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Although single agents against PDK1 or Akt
      did not affect EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation, a combination of PI3K/Akt
      and MEK inhibitors synergistically suppressed ERK activation and cellular
      growth. siRNA-mediated silencing of class I PI3K or Akt1/2 genes also
      significantly decreased U0126-resistant ERK phosphorylation. Our data
      suggest that in T47D cells ErbB family ligands induce a dynamic,
      PI3K/Akt-sensitive and MEK-independent compensatory ERK activation circuit
      that is absent in MCF7 cells. We discuss candidate proteins that can be
      involved in this activation circuitry and suggest that PDZ-Binding
      Kinase/T-LAK Cell-Originated Protein Kinase (PBK/TOPK) may play a role in
      mediating MEK-independent ERK activation.

TI  - PDK1 regulates vascular remodeling and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition in cardiac development.
PG  - 3711-21
AB  - One essential downstream signaling pathway of receptor tyrosine kinases
      (RTKs), such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and
      the Tie2 receptor, is the phosphoinositide-3 kinase
      (PI3K)-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)-Akt/protein
      kinase B (PKB) cascade that plays a critical role in development and
      tumorigenesis. However, the role of PDK1 in cardiovascular development
      remains unknown. Here, we deleted PDK1 specifically in endothelial cells
      in mice. These mice displayed hemorrhage and hydropericardium and died at
      approximately embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5). Histological analysis revealed
      defective vascular remodeling and development and disrupted integrity
      between the endothelium and trabeculae/myocardium in the heart. The
      atrioventricular canal (AVC) cushion and valves failed to form, indicating
      a defect in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), together with
      increased endothelial apoptosis. Consistently, ex vivo AVC explant culture
      showed impeded mesenchymal outgrowth. Snail protein was reduced and was
      absent from the nucleus in AVC cells. Delivery of the Snail S6A mutant to
      the AVC explant effectively rescued EMT defects. Furthermore, adenoviral
      Akt delivery rescued EMT defects in AVC explant culture, and deletion of
      PTEN delayed embryonic lethality of PDK1 endothelial deletion mice by 1
      day and rendered normal development of the AVC cushion in the
      PDK1-deficient heart. Taken together, these results have revealed an
      essential role of PDK1 in cardiovascular development through activation of
      Akt and Snail.

TI  - Plumbagin activates ERK1/2 and Akt via superoxide, Src and PI3-kinase in
      3T3-L1 cells.
PG  - 21-8
AB  - Plumbagin, derived from the plant Plumbago zeylanica, has been shown to
      chronically activate ERK1/2 and inhibit Akt activity in cancer cells.
      However, the acute effects of plumbagin on ERK1/2 and Akt activities
      remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of plumbagin on
      ERK1/2 and Akt activities in 3T3-L1 cells. Exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to
      plumbagin generated superoxide and activated both ERK1/2 and Akt. The
      plumbagin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt activities were sensitive to an
      antioxidant NAC, superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBAP, superoxide scavenger
      Tiron and NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor DPI. Plumbagin-stimulated ERK1/2
      activity was attenuated by the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and Ras inhibitor
      manumycin A, whereas plumbagin-stimulated Akt activity was blocked by the
      PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Both plumbagin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt
      activities were attenuated by PP2, a Src inhibitor. Interestingly,
      inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), but not Akt,
      activity leaded to attenuation of plumbagin-stimulated ERK1/2 activity.
      These results suggest that plumbagin activates NAD(P)H oxidase, Src, and
      PI3K, and that the activated PI3K or PDK1 subsequently stimulate Akt and
      Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 in 3T3-L1 cells.

TI  - Discovery of PDK1 kinase inhibitors with a novel mechanism of action by
      ultrahigh throughput screening.
PG  - 18838-46
AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway plays a key role in
      cancer cell growth, survival, and angiogenesis. Phosphoinositide-dependent
      protein kinase-1 (PDK1) acts at a focal point in this pathway immediately
      downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and PTEN, where it phosphorylates
      numerous AGC kinases. The PDK1 kinase domain has at least three
      ligand-binding sites: the ATP-binding pocket, the peptide
      substrate-binding site, and a groove in the N-terminal lobe that binds the
      C-terminal hydrophobic motif of its kinase substrates. Based on the unique
      PDK1 substrate recognition system, ultrahigh throughput TR-FRET and
      Alphascreen screening assays were developed using a biotinylated version
      of the PDK1-tide substrate containing the activation loop of AKT fused to
      a pseudo-activated hydrophobic motif peptide. Using full-length PDK1, K(m)
      values were determined as 5.6 mum for ATP and 40 nm for the fusion
      peptide, revealing 50-fold higher affinity compared with the classical
      AKT(Thr-308)-tide. Kinetic and biophysical studies confirmed the PDK1
      catalytic mechanism as a rapid equilibrium random bireactant reaction.
      Following an ultrahigh throughput screen of a large library, 2,000
      compounds were selected from the reconfirmed hits by computational
      analysis with a focus on novel scaffolds. ATP-competitive hits were
      deconvoluted by dose-response studies at 1x and 10x K(m) concentrations of
      ATP, and specificity of binding was assessed in thermal shift assay.
      Inhibition studies using fusion PDK1-tide1 substrate versus
      AKT(Thr-308)-tide and kinase selectivity profiling revealed a novel
      selective alkaloid scaffold that evidently binds to the PDK1-interacting
      fragment pocket. Molecular modeling suggests a structural paradigm for the
      design of inhibitory versus activating allosteric ligands of PDK1.

TI  - Physical association of PDK1 with AKT1 is sufficient for pathway
      activation independent of membrane localization and phosphatidylinositol 3
      kinase.
PG  - e9910
AB  - Frequent activation of the AKT serine-threonine kinase in cancer confers
      resistance to therapy. AKT is activated by a multi-step process involving
      phosphatidylinositide (PtdIns) phosphate-mediated recruitment of AKT and
      its upstream kinases, including 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
      (PDK1), to the inner surface of the cell membrane. PDK1 in the appropriate
      context phosphorylates AKT at threonine 308 (T308) to activate AKT.
      Whether PtdIns(3,4,5)Ps (PtdInsP3) binding and AKT membrane translocation
      mediate functions other than formation of a functional PDK1::AKT complex
      have not been fully elucidated. We fused complementary fragments of
      intensely fluorescent protein (IFP) to AKT1 and PDK1 to induce a stable
      complex to study the prerequisites of AKT1 phosphorylation and function.
      In the stabilized PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex, AKT1 T308 phosphorylation
      was independent of PtdIns, as demonstrated by treatment with
      Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. Further when interaction
      with PtdIns and the cell membrane was prevented by creating PH-domain
      mutants of AKT1 (R25A) and PDK1 (R474A), AKT1 phosphorylation on T308 was
      maintained in the PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex. The PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1
      complex was sufficient for phosphorylation of known AKT substrates, and
      conferred resistance to inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002, PI103, GDC0941 and
      TGX286) but not inhibitors of the downstream TORC1 complex (rapamycin).
      Thus the locus of action of targeted therapeutics can be elucidated by the
      constitutively active AKT1 complex. Our data indicate that PtdIns and
      membrane localization are not required for AKT phosphorylation and
      activation, but rather serve to induce a functional physical interaction
      between PDK1 and AKT. The PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex provides a
      cell-based platform to examine specificity of drugs targeting PI3K pathway
      components.

TI  - Effect of pressure overload on cardioprotection via PI3K-Akt: comparison
      of postconditioning, insulin, and pressure unloading.
PG  - 668-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postconditioning (PC) and insulin exert cardioprotection by
      activating phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling. Because
      pressure overload exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, we tested
      the hypothesis that (i) pressure overload attenuates PC- and
      insulin-induced cardioprotection, an effect caused by reduced PI3K-Akt
      signaling and (ii) pressure unloading confers cardioprotection comparable
      to either PC or insulin. METHODS: Infarct size (IS) and levels of relevant
      proteins (i.e., Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta),
      3'-phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), phosphatase and tensin
      homolog on chromosome ten (PTEN)) were determined in hearts subjected to
      IR. RESULTS: Pressure overload increased IS in association with changes in
      protein levels consistent with reduced PI3K-Akt signaling (i.e., ischemic
      reperfused vs. normoxic hearts). PC and insulin reduced IS but it was
      greater in hearts perfused at the higher, than the lower, pressure.
      Wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) partially reversed PC-induced
      cardioprotection, with IS being greater in the high-pressure group.
      Pressure unloading during reperfusion caused the most marked reduction in
      IS whereas pressure loading abolished PC-induced cardioprotection.
      Nonetheless, the phospho-Akt/total Akt ratios and phospho-GSK-3beta levels
      were unaffected by perfusion pressure in insulin-treated or
      postconditioned hearts. Moreover, protein levels were similar in
      pressure-unloaded and pressure-loaded hearts. CONCLUSIONS: Pressure
      overload reduces PI3K-Akt signaling following IR. However, a differential
      in PI3K-Akt signaling was not observed in ischemia-reperfused,
      insulin-treated, and postconditioned hearts, suggesting involvement of
      pathways other than PI3K-Akt for the effect of pressure on IS.
      Importantly, pressure unloading at reperfusion represents a novel and
      effective cardioprotective maneuver.

TI  - MicroRNA-375 is downregulated in gastric carcinomas and regulates cell
      survival by targeting PDK1 and 14-3-3zeta.
PG  - 2339-49
AB  - We investigated expression profiles of microRNA (miRNA) in gastric
      carcinomas by use of a miRNA microarray platform covering a total of 470
      human miRNAs. We identified 39 differentially expressed miRNAs in gastric
      carcinoma, of which six were significantly downregulated and the other 33
      were upregulated. We found that miRNA-375 (miR-375) was the most
      downregulated and that its ectopic expression in gastric carcinoma cells
      markedly reduced cell viability via the caspase-mediated apoptosis
      pathway. Interestingly, we found that expression of miR-375 inhibited
      expression of PDK1, which is a direct target of miR-375, followed by
      suppression of Akt phosphorylation. Further analysis by gene expression
      microarray revealed that 14-3-3zeta, a potent antiapoptotic gene, was
      significantly downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in cells
      transfected with miR-375. The activity of a luciferase reporter containing
      the miR-375 binding sequence at the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of
      14-3-3zeta mRNA was repressed by the ectopic expression of miR-375,
      suggesting that miR-375 targets the 3' UTR of 14-3-3zeta. In addition,
      knockdown of either PDK1 or 14-3-3zeta in gastric carcinoma cells induced
      caspase activation, which was also observed in miR-375-transfected cells,
      suggesting that miR-375 may exert its proapoptotic function, at least in
      part, through the downregulation of PDK1 and 14-3-3zeta. Taken together,
      we propose that miR-375 is a candidate tumor suppressor miRNA in gastric
      carcinoma.

TI  - The PKB/AKT pathway in cancer.
PG  - 34-44
AB  - PKB/AKT constitutes an important pathway that regulates the signaling of
      multiple essential biological processes. PTEN is a dual protein/lipid
      phosphatase whose main substrate is phosphatidyl-inositol,3,4,5
      triphosphate (PIP3), the product of PI3K. Increases in PIP3 result in the
      recruitment of PDK1 and AKT to the membrane where they are activated.
      Furthermore, PI3K can be activated by direct binding to oncogenic Ras
      proteins. Many components of this pathway have been described as
      genetically altered in cancer. PTEN activity is lost by mutations,
      deletions or promoter methylation at high frequency in many primary and
      metastatic human cancers, and some germline mutations of PTEN are found in
      several familial cancer predisposition syndromes. Activating mutations of
      PI3K occur in human tumors and confer tumorigenic properties to cells in
      culture. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the AKT pathway is a
      promising potential target for cancer chemotherapy. Indeed, many companies
      and academic laboratories have initiated a variety of approaches to
      inhibit the pathway at different points. Essentially, PI3Ks, PDK1, AKT and
      mTOR are heavily targeted for therapy in different ways. These proteins
      are kinases, which are very "druggable" targets a priori, and, according
      to the "addiction hypothesis", cancer cells with the activated pathway
      will be more dependent on its activity for their survival.

TI  - Chemotactic activation of Dictyostelium AGC-family kinases AKT and PKBR1
      requires separate but coordinated functions of PDK1 and TORC2.
PG  - 983-92
AB  - Protein kinases AKT and PKBR1 of Dictyostelium belong to the AGC protein
      kinase superfamily. AKT and PKBR1 are phosphorylated at similar sites by
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and TORC2 kinases; however,
      they have different subcellular localizing domains. AKT has a
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatidylinositol
      (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)]-regulated PH (pleckstrin
      homology) domain whereas PKBR1 is myristoylated and persistently membrane
      localized. Using strains defective for PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)-, PDK1- and
      TORC2-signaling or strains that express phospho-site mutants of AKT and
      PKBR1, we dissect the different roles of PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), PDK1 and
      TORC2. We show that activation of AKT and PKBR1 requires PDK1-site
      phosphorylation, but that phosphorylation by TORC2 is insufficient for AKT
      or PKBR1 activation. However, PDK1-site phosphorylation is dependent on
      phosphorylation by TORC2, which suggests that there is regulatory
      coordination among PDK1, TORC2 and their phospho-site targets. This
      defines a separate input for signaling in control of chemotaxis and
      dependency on PDK1 function. We also demonstrate that PDK1 in
      Dictyostelium functions independently of PI3K/PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3). Finally,
      we show that AKT and PKBR1 exhibit substrate selectivity and identify two
      novel lipid-interacting proteins preferentially phosphorylated by AKT.
      Despite certain similarities, AKT and PKBR1 have distinct regulatory paths
      that impact activation and effector targeting, with PDK1 serving a central
      role.

TI  - 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 regulates proliferation and
      survival of cancer cells with an activated mitogen-activated protein
      kinase pathway.
PG  - 421-32
AB  - Engagement of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases by insulin and growth
      factors activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and generates the
      second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. This second
      messenger leads to the recruitment of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase-1 (PDK1) to the proximal side of the plasma membrane, which results
      in the activation of AKT kinase. In addition, PDK1 can phosphorylate
      numerous other kinases, including p90RSK, a kinase downstream of
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that is important for cell
      proliferation and survival. Previous studies have shown that the loss of
      PDK1 sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation but
      have not focused on delineating the contribution of PDK1 to
      pathway-specific mutations associated with various cancers other than the
      PI3K/AKT pathway. In this study, we show that the reduction of PDK1 by
      RNAi in melanoma and colon cancer cell lines activated in the MAPK pathway
      results in significant cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Furthermore,
      PDK1 reduction in tumor cells resulted in impaired PAK kinase signaling,
      altered actin polymerization, and reduced cell migration. These studies
      show that PDK1 plays a pivotal role in MAPK and PI3K signaling in tumor
      cells.

TI  - Mitotic phosphorylation of Aki1 at Ser208 by cyclin B1-Cdk1 complex.
PG  - 872-6
AB  - Akt kinase-interacting protein 1 (Aki1)/Freud-1/CC2D1A is localized in the
      cytosol, nucleus, and centrosome. Aki1 plays distinct roles depending on
      its localization. In the cytosol, it acts as a scaffold protein in the
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt pathway. In the nucleus, it is a transcriptional
      repressor of the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor. In the centrosome, it
      regulates spindle pole localization of the cohesin subunit Scc1, thereby
      mediating centriole cohesion during mitosis. Although the function of Aki1
      has been well clarified, the regulatory machinery of Aki1 is poorly
      understood. We previously found that Aki1 in mitotic cells displayed
      reduced mobility on immunoblot analysis, but the reason for this was
      unclear. Here we show that the electrophoretic mobility shift of Aki1 is
      derived from mitotic phosphorylation. The cyclin B1-cyclin-dependent
      kinase 1 (Cdk1) complex was found to be one of the kinases responsible for
      Aki1 phosphorylation during mitosis. We identified the Ser(208) residue of
      Aki1 as a cyclin B1-Cdk1 phosphorylation site. Furthermore, cyclin B1-Cdk1
      inhibitor treatment was shown to attenuate the level of Aki1 in complex
      with Scc1, suggesting that Aki1 phosphorylation by cyclin B1-Cdk1
      contributes to Aki1-Scc1 complex formation. Our results indicate that
      cyclin B1-Cdk1 is a kinase of Aki1 during mitosis and that its
      phosphorylation of Aki1 may regulate mitotic function.

TI  - Modulation in activation and expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog
      on chromosome ten, Akt1, and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1:
      further evidence demonstrating altered phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling
      in postmortem brain of suicide subjects.
PG  - 1017-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling plays a crucial
      role in neuronal growth and plasticity. Recently, we demonstrated that
      suicide brain is associated with decreased activation and expression of
      selective catalytic and regulatory subunits of PI3-K. The present
      investigation examined the regulation and functional significance of
      compromised PI3-K in suicide brain at the level of upstream phosphatase
      and tensin homologue on chromosome ten (PTEN) and downstream substrates
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt. METHODS: Messenger
      RNA expression of Akt1, Akt3, PTEN, and PDK1 by competitive reverse
      transcription polymerase polymerase chain reaction; protein expression of
      Akt1, Akt3, PTEN, PDK1, phosphorylated Akt1 (Ser473 and Thr308),
      phosphorylated PDK1, and phosphorylated PTEN by Western blot; and
      catalytic activities of Akt1, Akt3, and PDK1 by enzymatic assays were
      determined in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus obtained from suicide
      subjects and nonpsychiatric control subjects. RESULTS: No significant
      changes in the expression of Akt1 or Akt3 were observed; however,
      catalytic activity of Akt1, but not of Akt3, was decreased in prefrontal
      cortex and hippocampus of suicide subjects, which was associated with
      decreased phosphorylation of Akt1 at Ser473 and Thr308. The catalytic
      activity of PDK1 and the level of phosphorylated PDK1 were also decreased
      in both brain areas without any change in expression levels of PDK1. On
      the other hand, messenger RNA and protein expression of PTEN was
      increased, whereas the level of phosphorylated PTEN was decreased.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates abnormalities in PI3-K signaling at
      several levels in brain of suicide subjects and suggests the possible
      involvement of aberrant PI3-K/Akt signaling in the pathogenic mechanisms
      of suicide.

TI  - Hydrogen peroxide inhibits mTOR signaling by activation of AMPKalpha
      leading to apoptosis of neuronal cells.
PG  - 762-73
AB  - Oxidative stress results in apoptosis of neuronal cells, leading to
      neurodegenerative disorders. However, the underlying molecular mechanism
      remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)),
      a major oxidant generated when oxidative stress occurs, induced apoptosis
      of neuronal cells (PC12 cells and primary murine neurons), by inhibiting
      the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated phosphorylation of
      ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
      (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a scavenger
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS), blocked H(2)O(2) inhibition of mTOR
      signaling. Ectopic expression of wild-type (wt) mTOR, constitutively
      active S6K1 or downregulation of 4E-BP1 partially prevented H(2)O(2)
      induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified that H(2)O(2) induction
      of ROS inhibited the upstream kinases, Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase 1 (PDK1), but not the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor
      (IGFR), and activated the negative regulator, AMP-activated protein kinase
      alpha (AMPKalpha), but not the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in
      the cells. Expression of a dominant negative AMPKalpha or downregulation
      of AMPKalpha1 conferred partial resistance to H(2)O(2) inhibition of
      phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, as well as cell viability, indicating
      that H(2)O(2) inhibition of mTOR signaling is at least in part through
      activation of AMPK. Our findings suggest that AMPK inhibitors may be
      exploited for prevention of H(2)O(2)-induced neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - PDK-1/FoxO1 pathway in POMC neurons regulates Pomc expression and food
      intake.
PG  - E787-98
AB  - Both insulin and leptin signaling converge on phosphatidylinositol 3-OH
      kinase [PI(3)K]/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1
      (PDK-1)/protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) in proopiomelanocortin
      (POMC) neurons. Forkhead box-containing protein-O1 (FoxO1) is inactivated
      in a PI(3)K-dependent manner. However, the interrelationship between
      PI(3)K/PDK-1/Akt and FoxO1, and the chronic effects of the overexpression
      of FoxO1 in POMC neurons on energy homeostasis has not been elucidated. To
      determine the extent to which PDK-1 and FoxO1 signaling in POMC neurons
      was responsible for energy homeostasis, we generated POMC neuron-specific
      Pdk1 knockout mice (POMCPdk1(-/-)) and mice selectively expressing a
      constitutively nuclear (CN)FoxO1 or transactivation-defective
      (Delta256)FoxO1 in POMC neurons (CNFoxO1(POMC) or Delta256FoxO1(POMC)).
      POMCPdk1(-/-) mice showed increased food intake and body weight
      accompanied by decreased expression of Pomc gene. The CNFoxO1(POMC) mice
      exhibited mild obesity and hyperphagia compared with POMCPdk1(-/-) mice.
      Although expression of the CNFoxO1 made POMCPdk1(-/-) mice more obese due
      to excessive suppression of Pomc gene, overexpression of Delta256FoxO1 in
      POMC neurons had no effects on metabolic phenotypes and Pomc expression
      levels of POMCPdk1(-/-) mice. These data suggest a requirement for PDK-1
      and FoxO1 in transcriptional regulation of Pomc and food intake.

TI  - Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and small for gestational age (SGA):
      genetic alterations.
PG  - 33-55
AB  - Short stature associated with GH deficiency has been estimated to occur in
      about 1 in 4000 to 1 in 10,000 in various studies. In the last decade new
      genetic defects have been described in all the levels of the growth
      hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH)-GH-IGF (insulin-like growth factor)
      axis. Genetic defects in the GHRH and in various parts of the Insulin-like
      growth factor system have been demonstrated. Genetic defects causing
      isolated GH deficiency (GHD), as well as multiple pituitary hormonal
      deficiencies have been analysed in detail. Signalling molecules and
      transcription factors leading to the development of the pituitary gland
      have been discovered and their function recognized. In animal models and
      in humans the importance of the transcription factors HESX1, PROP1,
      POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3 has been extensively studied.
      Genetic alterations of those transcription factors dictate the highly
      variable phenotype: from isolated hypopituitarism to multiple pituitary
      hormonal deficiencies with or without malformations (e.g. septo-optic
      dysplasia or holoprosencephaly). Small for gestational age (SGA) children
      are increasingly recognized to be a heterogeneous group in which new
      mechanisms of growth retardation and metabolic disturbances have been
      proposed. Since SGA is considered to be the main reason for the short
      stature in 10% of short adults this is a large group with a great
      potential for novel insights into mechanisms of growth and metabolic
      disturbances. A group of signalling proteins are involved in prenatal
      (SGA) growth retardation: IRS-1, PDK1, AKT1, and S6K1. In addition, an
      attractive modern theory supposes that a disturbed mother-placenta-foetus
      relation results in the activation of the so-called "thrifty phenotype" of
      which the IGF system is a vital part. The mechanisms assure short-term
      postnatal survival in conditions of deficient nutritional supply. However,
      as a consequence, the abundant postnatal nutritional supply and the
      "thrifty phenotype" result in increased adult risk of metabolic syndrome,
      diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and cardiovascular disease. The manuscript
      reviews in brief genetic alterations in humans leading to growth hormone
      deficiency (GHD), multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD) and SGA.

TI  - Regulation of Akt signaling activation by ubiquitination.
PG  - 487-97
AB  - Akt (also known as PKB) signaling orchestrates many aspects of biological
      functions and, importantly, its deregulation is linked to cancer
      development. Akt activity is well-known regulated through its
      phosphorylation at T308 and S473 by PDK1 and mTOrC2, respectively.
      Although in the last decade the research has been primarily focused on Akt
      phosphorylation and its role in Akt activation and functions, other
      posttranslational modifications on Akt have never been reported. Until
      very recently, a novel posttranslational modification on Akt termed
      ubiquitination was identified and shown to play an important role in Akt
      activation. The cancer-associated Akt mutant recently identified in a
      subset of human cancers displays enhanced Akt ubiquitination, in turn
      contributing to Akt hyperactivation, suggesting a potential role of Akt
      ubiquitination in cancers. Thus, this novel posttranslational modification
      on Akt reveals an exciting avenue that has advanced our current
      understandings of how Akt signaling activation is regulated.

TI  - Beyond rapalog therapy: preclinical pharmacology and antitumor activity of
      WYE-125132, an ATP-competitive and specific inhibitor of mTORC1 and
      mTORC2.
PG  - 621-31
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major component of the
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway that is
      dysregulated in 50% of all human malignancies. Rapamycin and its analogues
      (rapalogs) partially inhibit mTOR through allosteric binding to mTOR
      complex 1 (mTORC1) but not mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), an emerging player in
      cancer. Here, we report WYE-125132 (WYE-132), a highly potent,
      ATP-competitive, and specific mTOR kinase inhibitor (IC(50): 0.19 +/- 0.07
      nmol/L; >5,000-fold selective versus PI3Ks). WYE-132 inhibited mTORC1 and
      mTORC2 in diverse cancer models in vitro and in vivo. Importantly,
      consistent with genetic ablation of mTORC2, WYE-132 targeted P-AKT(S473)
      and AKT function without significantly reducing the steady-state level of
      the PI3K/PDK1 activity biomarker P-AKT(T308), highlighting a prominent and
      direct regulation of AKT by mTORC2 in cancer cells. Compared with the
      rapalog temsirolimus/CCI-779, WYE-132 elicited a substantially stronger
      inhibition of cancer cell growth and survival, protein synthesis, cell
      size, bioenergetic metabolism, and adaptation to hypoxia. Oral
      administration of WYE-132 to tumor-bearing mice showed potent single-agent
      antitumor activity against MDA361 breast, U87MG glioma, A549 and H1975
      lung, as well as A498 and 786-O renal tumors. An optimal dose of WYE-132
      achieved a substantial regression of MDA361 and A549 large tumors and
      caused complete regression of A498 large tumors when coadministered with
      bevacizumab. Our results further validate mTOR as a critical driver for
      tumor growth, establish WYE-132 as a potent and profound anticancer agent,
      and provide a strong rationale for clinical development of specific mTOR
      kinase inhibitors as new cancer therapy.

TI  - The role of PI 3-kinase p110beta in AKT signally, cell survival, and
      proliferation in human prostate cancer cells.
PG  - 755-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Class IA PI 3-kinases produce phosphatidylinositol
      (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 is bound by AKT which facilities its
      activation by PDK1. Activated AKT promotes cell survival and stimulates
      cell proliferation. Class IA PI 3-kinases are heterodimers consisting of a
      regulatory subunit p85 and a catalytic subunit p110. The p110alpha isoform
      has been shown to be mutated in a number of tumor types. A number of
      recent studies suggest that the p110beta isoform may be functionally
      relevant in prostate cancer. In this study we extend this work to include
      the examination of the expression and functional properties of p110alpha
      and p110beta in three different prostate cancer cell lines, DU145, LNCaP,
      PC3, as well as the non-tumorigenic but immortalized RWPE1 prostate
      epithelial cell line. METHODS: Western blot analysis was used to measure
      protein expression and quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA
      levels. After targeted knockdown using isoform-specific siRNAs to reduce
      PI 3-kinase p110alpha or p110beta isoform expression, we measured
      downstream signally events such as phosphorylation of AKT, ERK 1/2, PDK,
      and FOXO, as well as biological consequences such as changes in apoptosis,
      and alterations in cell cycle progression. RESULTS: In all three prostate
      cancer cell lines examined, targeted knockdown of p110beta, and not
      p110alpha, resulted in significantly reduced AKT, PDK, and FOXO
      phosphorylation. While knockdown of either p110 isoform resulted in an
      increase in apoptosis and a cell cycle arrest in G1 in the remaining
      non-apoptotic cells, these effects were much more pronounced with
      knockdown of p110beta. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that
      p110beta appears to be the predominant functional class I PI 3-kinase
      isoform in prostate cancer cells.

TI  - A novel inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway based on the structure of
      inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate.
PG  - 104-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owing to its role in cancer, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
      (PI3K)/Akt pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
      We previously reported that the inhibition of Akt by inositol
      1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP(5)) results in anti-tumour properties.
      To further develop this compound we modified its structure to obtain more
      potent inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway. METHODS: Cell
      proliferation/survival was determined by cell counting, sulphorhodamine or
      acridine orange/ethidium bromide assay; Akt activation was determined by
      western blot analysis. In vivo effect of compounds was tested on PC3
      xenografts, whereas in vitro activity on kinases was determined by
      SelectScreen Kinase Profiling Service. RESULTS: The derivative
      2-O-benzyl-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (2-O-Bn-InsP(5)) is
      active towards cancer types resistant to InsP(5) in vitro and in vivo.
      2-O-Bn-InsP(5) possesses higher pro-apoptotic activity than InsP(5) in
      sensitive cells and enhances the effect of anti-cancer compounds.
      2-O-Bn-InsP(5) specifically inhibits 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase 1 (PDK1) in vitro (IC(50) in the low nanomolar range) and the
      PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in cell lines and excised tumours.
      It is interesting to note that 2-O-Bn-InsP(5) also inhibits the mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: InsP(5) and
      2-O-Bn-InsP(5) may represent lead compounds to develop novel inhibitors of
      the PI3K/Akt pathway (including potential dual PDK1/mTOR inhibitors) and
      novel potential anti-cancer drugs.

TI  - Activation of the cardiac mTOR/p70(S6K) pathway by leucine requires PDK1
      and correlates with PRAS40 phosphorylation.
PG  - E761-9
AB  - Like insulin, leucine stimulates the mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70(S6K)) axis in various organs. Insulin
      proceeds via the canonical association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      (PI3K), phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), and protein
      kinase B (PKB/Akt). The signaling involved in leucine effect, although
      known to implicate a PI3K mechanism independent of PKB/Akt, is more poorly
      understood. In this study, we investigated whether PDK1 could also
      participate in the events leading to mTOR/p70(S6K) activation in response
      to leucine in the heart. In wild-type hearts, both leucine and insulin
      increased p70(S6K) activity whereas, in contrast to insulin, leucine was
      unable to activate PKB/Akt. The changes in p70(S6K) activity induced by
      insulin and leucine correlated with changes in phosphorylation of
      Thr(389), the mTOR phosphorylation site on p70(S6K), and of Ser(2448) on
      mTOR, both related to mTOR activity. Leucine also triggered
      phosphorylation of the proline-rich Akt/PKB substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40),
      a new pivotal mTOR regulator. In PDK1 knockout hearts, leucine, similarly
      to insulin, failed to induce the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70(S6K),
      leading to the absence of p70(S6K) activation. The loss of leucine effect
      in absence of PDK1 correlated with the lack of PRAS40 phosphorylation.
      Moreover, the introduction in PDK1 of the L155E mutation, which is known
      to preserve the insulin-induced and PKB/Akt-dependent phosphorylation of
      mTOR/p70(S6K), suppressed all leucine effects, including phosphorylation
      of mTOR, PRAS40, and p70(S6K). We conclude that the leucine-induced
      stimulation of the cardiac PRAS40/mTOR/p70(S6K) pathway requires PDK1 in a
      way that differs from that of insulin.

TI  - Selective disruption of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling via
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 prevents the protective effect of
      IGF-1 on human cancer cell death.
PG  - 6563-72
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling system exerts a broad
      antiapoptotic function and plays a crucial role in resistance to
      anticancer therapies. Exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to IGF-1
      rapidly and transiently induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). This was paralleled by
      Akt/protein kinase B and protein kinase C-zeta phosphorylation, at
      Thr(308) and Thr(410), respectively. IGF-1 treatment also enhanced PDK1
      interaction with IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in intact MCF-7 cells. Pulldown
      assays revealed that PDK1 bound IGF-1R in vitro and that the region
      encompassing amino acids 51-359 of PDK1 was necessary for the interaction.
      Synthetic peptides corresponding to IGF-1R C terminus amino acids
      1295-1337 (C43) and to PDK1 amino acids 114-141 reduced in vitro
      IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Loading of
      fluoresceinated-C43 (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-C43) into MCF-7
      cells significantly reduced IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction and phosphorylation of
      PDK1 substrates. Moreover, FITC-C43 intracellular loading reverted the
      protective effect of IGF-1 on growth factor deprivation-induced cell
      death. Finally, the inhibition of IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction and signaling by
      FITC-C43 was accompanied by 2-fold enhanced killing capacity of cetuximab
      in human GEO colon adenocarcinoma cells and was sufficient to restore cell
      death in cetuximab-resistant cell clones. Thus, disruption of PDK1
      interaction with IGF-1R reduces IGF-1 survival effects in cancer cells and
      may enhance cell death by anticancer agents.

TI  - Small-molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling
      inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin pathway cross-talk and suppress medulloblastoma
      growth.
PG  - 266-76
AB  - Activation of the beta-catenin and receptor kinase pathways occurs often
      in medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor. In
      this study, we show that molecular cross-talk between the beta-catenin and
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways is crucial to
      sustain medulloblastoma pathophysiology. Constitutive activation of
      phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), Akt, and
      phosphorylation of [corrected] glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta)
      was detected by immunohistochemistry in all primary medulloblastomas
      examined (n = 41). Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt
      signaling pathway affected beta-catenin signaling by activation
      [corrected] of GSK-3beta, [corrected] resulting in cytoplasmic retention
      of beta-catenin and reduced expression of its target genes cyclin D1 and
      c-Myc. The PDK1 inhibitor OSU03012 induced mitochondrial-dependent
      apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of
      chemotherapeutic drugs in a synergistic or additive manner. In vivo,
      OSU03012 inhibited the growth of established medulloblastoma xenograft
      tumors in a dose-dependent manner and augmented the antitumor effects of
      mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor CCI-779. These findings
      demonstrate the importance of cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and
      beta-catenin pathways in medulloblastoma and rationalize the PI3K/Akt
      signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in treatment of this disease.

TI  - The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.
PG  - 9-22
AB  - The AGC kinase subfamily of protein kinases contains 60 members, including
      PKA, PKG and PKC. The family comprises some intensely examined protein
      kinases (such as Akt, S6K, RSK, MSK, PDK1 and GRK) as well as many less
      well-studied enzymes (such as SGK, NDR, LATS, CRIK, SGK494, PRKX, PRKY and
      MAST). Research has shed new light onto the architecture and regulatory
      mechanisms of these kinases. In addition, AGC kinases mediate diverse and
      important cellular functions, and their mutation and/or dysregulation
      contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer
      and diabetes.

TI  - Regulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/AKT kinase-mediated
      insulin signaling by O-Linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine in 3T3-L1
      adipocytes.
PG  - 5204-11
AB  - Increased O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is associated with
      insulin resistance in muscle and adipocytes. Upon insulin treatment of
      insulin-responsive adipocytes, O-GlcNAcylation of several proteins is
      increased. Key insulin signaling proteins, including IRS-1, IRS-2, and
      PDK1, are substrates for OGT, suggesting potential O-GlcNAc control points
      within the pathway. To elucidate the roles of O-GlcNAc in dampening
      insulin signaling (Vosseller, K., Wells, L., Lane, M. D., and Hart, G. W.
      (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 5313-5318), we focused on the
      pathway upstream of AKT. Increasing O-GlcNAc in 3T3-L1 adipocytes
      decreases phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) interactions with both IRS-1
      and IRS-2. Elevated O-GlcNAc also reduces phosphorylation of the PI3K p85
      binding motifs (YXXM) of IRS-1 and results in a concomitant reduction in
      tyrosine phosphorylation of Y(608)XXM in IRS-1, one of the two main PI3K
      p85 binding motifs. Additionally, insulin signaling stimulates the
      interaction of OGT with PDK1. We conclude that one of the steps at which
      O-GlcNAc contributes to insulin resistance is by inhibiting
      phosphorylation at the Y(608)XXM PI3K p85 binding motif in IRS-1 and
      possibly at PDK1 as well.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis-induced expression of Leukotactin-1 is mediated
      by the PI3-K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathway.
PG  - 35-9
AB  - Chemokines function in the migration of circulating leukocytes to regions
      of inflammation, and have been implicated in chronic inflammatory
      conditions including mycobacterial infection. We investigated whether
      Leukotactin-1 (Lkn-1), a novel member of the CC-chemokines, is involved in
      the immune response of macrophages against Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      (MTB). In PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, MTB infection increased mRNA
      expression of Lkn-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Lkn-1 induction peaked 12
      h after infection, then declined gradually and returned to its basal level
      at 72 h. Secretion of Lkn-1 was elevated by MTB infection. The increase in
      expression and secretion of Lkn-1 caused by MTB was reduced in cells
      treated with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K),
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt. MTB-induced Akt
      phosphorylation was blocked by treatment with a PI3-K inhibitor or a PDK1
      inhibitor, implying that PI3-K, PDK1, and Akt are associated with the
      signaling pathway that up-regulates Lkn-1 in response to MTB. These
      results suggest that Lkn-1 is novel member of the group of chemokines that
      is released by macrophages infected with MTB.

TI  - Role of PKCzeta translocation in the development of type 2 diabetes in
      rats following continuous glucose infusion.
PG  - 59-70
AB  - AIM: We investigated the molecular mechanisms of hyperglycaemia-induced
      insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in rats receiving a continuous
      glucose infusion (GI). METHODS: Female Wistar rats were infused with
      either 2.8 mol/L glucose or saline (2 mL/h) for durations varying from 0
      to 15 days. Blood samples were analysed daily to determine glucose and
      insulin dynamics. Subsets of animals were sacrificed and soleus muscles
      were extracted for determination of protein expression, subcellular
      location, and activities of insulin-signalling proteins. RESULTS: Rats
      accommodated this systemic glucose oversupply and developed insulin
      resistance on day 5 (normoglycaemia/hyperinsulinaemia) and type 2 diabetes
      on day 15 (hyperglycaemia/normoinsulinaemia). The effect of GI on protein
      kinase Czeta (PKCzeta) activity was independent of changes in
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and occurred in parallel with an
      increase in PDK1 activity. Activated PKCzeta was mainly located in the
      cytosol after 5 days of GI that was coincident with the translocation of
      GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, and normoglycaemia. After 15 days of GI,
      PKCzeta translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane with a
      concomitant decrease in PDK1 activity. This caused an increase in the
      association between PKCzeta and PKB and a decrease in PDK1-PKB reactions
      at the plasma membrane, leading to reduced PKB activity. The activity of
      PKCzeta per se was also compromised. The PKCzeta and PKB activity
      reduction and the blunted insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation
      eventually led to hyperglycaemia and diabetes. CONCLUSION: Translocation
      of PKCzeta may play a central role in the development of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Initiation of neuronal differentiation requires PI3-kinase/TOR signalling
      in the vertebrate neural tube.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - Regulated neuron production within the vertebrate nervous system relies on
      input from multiple signalling pathways. Work in the Drosophila retina has
      demonstrated that PI3-kinase and downstream TOR signalling regulate the
      timing of photoreceptor differentiation; however, the function of such
      signals during vertebrate neurogenesis is not well understood. Here we
      show that mutant mice lacking PKB activity downstream of PDK1, the master
      kinase of the PI3-kinase pathway, exhibit deficient neuron production. We
      further demonstrate expression of PI3-kinase signalling components and
      active PKB and TOR signalling in the chick spinal cord, an early site of
      neurogenesis. Neuron production was also attenuated in the chick neural
      tube following exposure to small molecule inhibitors of PI3-kinase
      (LY294002) or TOR (Rapamycin) activity. Furthermore, Rapamycin repressed
      expression of early neuronal differentiation genes, such as Ngn2, but did
      not inhibit expression of Sox1B genes characteristic of proliferating
      neural progenitors. In addition, some cells expressing an early neuronal
      marker were mis-localised at the ventricular surface in the presence of
      Rapamycin and remained aberrantly within the cell cycle. These findings
      suggest that TOR signalling is necessary to initiate neuronal
      differentiation and that it may facilitate coordination of cell cycle and
      differentiation programmes. In contrast, stimulating PI3-kinase signalling
      did not increase neuron production, suggesting that such activity is
      simply permissive for vertebrate neurogenesis.

TI  - c-Jun regulates phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 transcription:
      implication for Akt and protein kinase C activities and melanoma
      tumorigenesis.
PG  - 903-13
AB  - Mutations in N-RAS and B-RAF, which commonly occur in melanomas, result in
      constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling.
      Active ERK increases expression and activity of the c-Jun transcription
      factor, linking ERK and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascades. Here, we
      show that c-Jun regulates transcription of phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase 1 (PDK1) with a concomitant impact on Akt and protein kinase C
      (PKC) activity and related substrates. Inhibition of c-Jun reduces PDK1
      expression and attenuates Akt and PKC activity, which can be restored by
      exogenous PDK1. c-Jun regulation of PDK1 in melanoma contributes to growth
      rate and the ability to form tumors in mice. Correspondingly, increased
      levels of c-Jun in melanoma cell lines coincide with up-regulation of PDK1
      and phosphorylation of PKC and Akt. The identification of c-Jun as a
      transcriptional regulator of PDK1 expression highlights key mechanisms
      underlying c-Jun oncogenic activity, and provides new insight into the
      nature of up-regulated Akt and PKC in melanoma.

TI  - PDK1 regulates chemotaxis in human neutrophils.
PG  - 1119-24
AB  - Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1) plays a central role in signal
      transduction mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) and
      regulates cellular functions in neutrophils. Neutrophils from individuals
      diagnosed with localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) present an in vivo
      phenotype with depressed chemotaxis. The aim of this study was to test the
      hypothesis that PDK1 regulates chemotaxis in neutrophils and is
      responsible for the abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis LAP. Neutrophil
      chemotaxis was significantly suppressed by the PDK1 inhibitor
      staurosporine. When cells were transfected with PDK1 siRNA, there was a
      significant reduction in chemotaxis, while superoxide generation was not
      significantly affected. In primary neutrophils from persons with LAP, PDK1
      expression and activation levels were significantly reduced, and this
      reduction was associated with the reduced phosphorylation of Akt (Thr308)
      and chemotaxis. Analysis of these data demonstrates that PDK1 is essential
      for the chemotactic migration of neutrophils, and in the absence of PDK1,
      neutrophil chemotaxis is impaired.

TI  - Discovery of potent and selective inhibitors of the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) kinase.
PG  - 7081-9
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cell
      growth, metabolism, and angiogenesis and an emerging target in cancer
      research. High throughput screening (HTS) of our compound collection led
      to the identification of
      3-(4-morpholin-4-yl-1-piperidin-4-yl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)phen
      ol (5a), a modestly potent and nonselective inhibitor of mTOR and
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Optimization of compound 5a, employing
      an mTOR homology model based on an X-ray crystal structure of closely
      related PI3Kgamma led to the discovery of
      6-(1H-indol-5-yl)-4-morpholin-4-yl-1-[1-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-yl
      ]-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (5u), a potent and selective mTOR inhibitor
      (mTOR IC(50) = 9 nM; PI3Kalpha IC(50) = 1962 nM). Compound 5u selectively
      inhibited cellular biomarker of mTORC1 (P-S6K, P-4EBP1) and mTORC2 (P-AKT
      S473) over the biomarker of PI3K/PDK1 (P-AKT T308) and did not inhibit
      PI3K-related kinases (PIKKs) in cellular assays. These pyrazolopyrimidines
      represent an exciting new series of mTOR-selective inhibitors with
      potential for development for cancer therapy.

TI  - Akt1 intramitochondrial cycling is a crucial step in the redox modulation
      of cell cycle progression.
PG  - e7523
AB  - Akt is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell proliferation,
      apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. Akt is differentially activated by
      growth factors and oxidative stress by sequential phosphorylation of
      Ser(473) by mTORC2 and Thr(308) by PDK1. On these bases, we investigated
      the mechanistic connection of H(2)O(2) yield, mitochondrial activation of
      Akt1 and cell cycle progression in NIH/3T3 cell line with confocal
      microscopy, in vivo imaging, and directed mutagenesis. We demonstrate that
      modulation by H(2)O(2) entails the entrance of cytosolic P-Akt1 Ser(473)
      to mitochondria, where it is further phosphorylated at Thr(308) by
      constitutive PDK1. Phosphorylation of Thr(308) in mitochondria determines
      Akt1 passage to nuclei and triggers genomic post-translational mechanisms
      for cell proliferation. At high H(2)O(2), Akt1-PDK1 association is
      disrupted and P-Akt1 Ser(473) accumulates in mitochondria in detriment to
      nuclear translocation; accordingly, Akt1 T308A is retained in
      mitochondria. Low Akt1 activity increases cytochrome c release to cytosol
      leading to apoptosis. As assessed by mass spectra, differential H(2)O(2)
      effects on Akt1-PDK interaction depend on the selective oxidation of
      Cys(310) to sulfenic or cysteic acids. These results indicate that Akt1
      intramitochondrial-cycling is central for redox modulation of cell fate.

TI  - Insulin resistance due to lipid-induced signaling defects could be
      prevented by mahanine.
PG  - 97-107
AB  - It is well known that free fatty acids (FFAs) play a key role in
      implementing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Resources of chemical
      compounds that intervene the derogatory effect of FFAs are indeed very
      limited. We have isolated mahanine, a carbazole alkaloid, from the leaves
      of Murraya koenegii that prevented palmitate-induced inhibition of
      insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRbeta, PI3K, PDK1, and Akt in L6
      myotubes. This was also reflected in the palmitate-induced inhibition of
      insulin-stimulated [(3)H] 2-DOG uptake by L6 myotubes, where palmitate
      adverse effect was significantly blocked by mahanine. Previous reports
      indicated that one of the major targets of lipid-induced damage in insulin
      signaling pathway resulting impairment of insulin sensitivity is insulin
      receptor (IR). Here, we have observed that palmitate significantly
      increased pPKCepsilon in both cytosol and nuclear region of L6 myotubes in
      comparison to control. Translocation of pPKCepsilon to the nucleus was
      associated with the impairment of HMGA1, the architectural transcription
      factor of IR gene and all these were reversed by mahanine.
      Palmitate-induced activation of IKK/IkappaBeta/NF-kappaBeta pathway was
      also attenuated by mahanine. Taken together, mahanine showed encouraging
      possibility to deal with lipid induced insulin resistance. In order to
      examine it further, mahanine was administered on nutritionally induced
      type 2 diabetic golden hamsters; it significantly improved hyperglycemia
      in all the treated animals. Our results, therefore, suggest that mahanine
      acts on two important sites of lipid induced insulin resistance (i)
      impairment of IR gene expression and (ii) activation of NF-kappaBeta
      pathway, thus, showing promise for its therapeutic choice for type 2
      diabetes.

TI  - Development of high-throughput TR-FRET and AlphaScreen assays for
      identification of potent inhibitors of PDK1.
PG  - 1257-62
AB  - The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a key role in cancer cell growth,
      survival, and tumor angiogenesis. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase 1 (PDK1) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, which catalyzes the
      phosphorylation of a conserved residue in the activation loop of a number
      of AGC kinases, including proto-oncogenes Akt, p70S6K, and RSK kinases. To
      find new small-molecule inhibitors of this important regulator kinase, the
      authors have developed PDK1-specific high-throughput enzymatic assays in
      time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) and
      AlphaScreen formats, monitoring phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide
      substrate derived from the activation loop of Akt. Development of
      homogeneous assays enabled screening of a focused kinase library of
      approximately 21,500 compounds in 1536-well TR-FRET format in duplicate.
      Upon validation of hits in an alternative 384-well AlphaScreen assay,
      several classes of structurally diverse PDK1 inhibitors, including
      tetracyclics, tricyclics, azaindoles, indazoles, and indenylpyrazoles,
      were identified, thus confirming the utility and sensitivity of the
      developed assays. Further testing in PC3 prostate cancer cells confirmed
      that representatives of the tetracyclic series showed intracellular
      modulation of the PDK1 activity, as evident from decreased phosphorylation
      levels of AKT, RSK, and S6-ribosomal protein.

TI  - Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 controls migration and malignant
      transformation but not cell growth and proliferation in PTEN-null
      lymphocytes.
PG  - 2441-54
AB  - In normal T cell progenitors, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase l
      (PDK1)-mediated phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B (PKB)
      is essential for the phosphorylation and inactivation of Foxo family
      transcription factors, and also controls T cell growth and proliferation.
      The current study has characterized the role of PDK1 in the pathology
      caused by deletion of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin
      homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN). PDK1 is shown to be essential
      for lymphomagenesis caused by deletion of PTEN in T cell progenitors.
      However, PTEN deletion bypasses the normal PDK1-controlled signaling
      pathways that determine thymocyte growth and proliferation. PDK1 does have
      important functions in PTEN-null thymocytes, notably to control the
      PKB-Foxo signaling axis and to direct the repertoire of adhesion and
      chemokine receptors expressed by PTEN-null T cells. The results thus
      provide two novel insights concerning pathological signaling caused by
      PTEN loss in lymphocytes. First, PTEN deletion bypasses the normal
      PDK1-controlled metabolic checkpoints that determine cell growth and
      proliferation. Second, PDK1 determines the cohort of chemokine and
      adhesion receptors expressed by PTEN-null cells, thereby controlling their
      migratory capacity.

TI  - The NF-kappaB/AKT-dependent Induction of Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer
      Cells by Macrophages and IL-1beta.
AB  - Progression of colon cancer from microadenoma to macroscopic tumors is
      coupled to augmentation of canonical Wnt signaling. We recently reported
      that tumor associated macrophages, through interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta)
      dependent phosphorylation of GSK3beta, promote Wnt signaling in colon
      cancer cells, demonstrating that proinflammatory cytokines can enhance
      TCF4/beta-catenin transcriptional activity in tumor cells. Here we
      investigated the pathway whereby IL-1beta inactivates GSK3beta and
      promotes Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells. We showed that normal human
      monocytes, THP1 macrophages and IL-1 failed to induce Wnt signaling in
      tumor cells expressing dominant negative IkappaB (dnIkappaB),
      demonstrating that macrophages and IL-1 activate Wnt signaling in a
      NF-kappaB-dependent manner. NF-kappaB activity was required for
      macrophages and IL-1 to activate PDK1 and AKT in tumor cells and thereby
      inhibit GSK3beta activity. Consistently, dominant negative AKT (dnAKT), or
      pharmacological inhibition of AKT in tumor cells, prevented
      macrophage/IL-1 mediated phosphorylation of GSK3beta, activation of Wnt
      signaling, and induction of c-jun and c-myc, confirming that macrophages
      and IL-1 promote Wnt signaling in an AKT dependent manner. Finally, we
      showed IL-1 and macrophages failed to promote growth of colon cancer cells
      with impaired NF-kappaB or AKT signaling, confirming the requirement for
      NF-kappaB and AKT activation for the protumorigenic activity of tumor
      associated macrophages. Thus, we showed that IL-1 and tumor associated
      macrophages activate NF-kappaB-dependent PDK1/AKT signaling in tumor
      cells, and thereby inactivate GSK3beta, enhance Wnt signaling and promote
      growth of colon cancer cells, establishing a novel molecular link between
      inflammation and tumor growth.

TI  - Sulfur mustard analog induces oxidative stress and activates signaling
      cascades in the skin of SKH-1 hairless mice.
PG  - 1640-51
AB  - A monofunctional analog of the chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard (HD),
      2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), induces tissue damage similar to HD.
      Herein we studied the molecular mechanisms associated with CEES-induced
      skin inflammation and toxicity in SKH-1 hairless mice. Topical CEES
      exposure caused an increase in oxidative stress as observed by enhanced
      4-hydroxynonenal and 5,5-dimethyl-2-(8-octanoic acid)-1-pyrroline N-oxide
      protein adduct formation and an increase in protein oxidation. The
      CEES-induced increase in the formation of 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine indicated
      DNA oxidation. CEES exposure instigated an increase in the phosphorylation
      of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; ERK1/2, JNK, and p38). After
      CEES exposure, a significant increase in the phosphorylation of Akt at
      Ser473 and Thr308 was observed as well as upregulation of its upstream
      effector, PDK1, in mouse skin tissue. Subsequently, CEES exposure caused
      activation of AP-1 family proteins and the NF-kappaB pathway, including
      phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in addition to
      phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB essential modulator. Collectively, our
      results indicate that CEES induces oxidative stress and the activation of
      the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB via upstream signaling
      pathways including MAPKs and Akt in SKH-1 hairless mouse skin. These novel
      molecular targets could be supportive in the development of prophylactic
      and therapeutic interventions against HD-related skin injury.

TI  - Phosphoinositide (3,4,5)-triphosphate binding to
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 regulates a protein kinase B/Akt
      signaling threshold that dictates T-cell migration, not proliferation.
PG  - 5952-62
AB  - The present study explored the consequences of phosphoinositide
      (3,4,5)-triphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P(3)] binding to the pleckstrin homology
      (PH) domain of the serine/threonine kinase 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase 1 (PDK1). The salient finding is that PDK1 directly transduces the
      PI(3,4,5)P(3) signaling that determines T-cell trafficking programs but
      not T-cell growth and proliferation. The integrity of the PDK1 PH domain
      thus is not required for PDK1 catalytic activity or to support cell
      survival and the proliferation of thymic and peripheral T cells. However,
      a PDK1 mutant that cannot bind PI(3,4,5)P(3) cannot trigger the signals
      that terminate the expression of the transcription factor KLF2 in
      activated T cells and cannot switch the chemokine and adhesion receptor
      profile of naive T cells to the profile of effector T cells. The PDK1 PH
      domain also is required for the maximal activation of Akt/protein kinase B
      (PKB) and for the maximal phosphorylation and inactivation of Foxo family
      transcription factors in T cells. PI(3,4,5)P(3) binding to PDK1 and the
      strength of PKB activity thus can dictate the nature of the T-cell
      response. Low levels of PKB activity can be sufficient for T-cell
      proliferation but insufficient to initiate the migratory program of
      effector T cells.

TI  - Mutation of the Rb1 pathway leads to overexpression of mTor, constitutive
      phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473, resistance to anoikis, and a block
      in c-Raf activation.
PG  - 5710-7
AB  - Atk can be activated by two independent phosphorylation events. Growth
      factor-dependent phosphorylation of threonine 308 (Akt-308) by
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent PDK1 leads to activation of
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) complex 1 (TORC1) and stimulation of
      protein synthesis. Phosphorylation on serine 473 (Akt-473) is catalyzed by
      mTor in a second complex (TORC2), and Akt-473 phosphorylates Foxo3a to
      inhibit apoptosis. Accumulation of both phosphorylated forms of Akt is
      frequent in cancer, and TORC2 activity is required for progression to
      prostate cancer with Pten mutation. Here, we link Akt-473 to the Rb1
      pathway and show that mTor is overexpressed with loss of the Rb1 family
      pathway. This leads to constitutive Akt-473 and, in turn, phosphorylation
      of Foxo3a and resistance to cell adhesion-dependent apoptosis (anoikis).
      Additionally, Akt-473 accumulation blocks c-Raf activation, thereby
      preventing downstream Erk activation. This block cannot be overcome by
      constitutively active Ras, and it also prevents induction of the Arf tumor
      suppressor by Ras. These studies link inactivation of the Rb1 pathway, a
      hallmark of cancer, to accumulation of Akt-473, resistance to anoikis, and
      a block in c-Raf/Erk activation.

TI  - Regulation and importance of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in
      hematologic malignancies.
PG  - 1024-38
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a heterodimeric lipid kinase, is a
      key enzyme in signal transduction from various stimuli to downstream
      pathways that elicit diverse responses involving growth, proliferation,
      survival, differentiation, and metabolism in many cellular systems.
      Activated PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, which
      recruits phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt
      serine/threonine kinase at the plasma membrane, resulting in activation of
      Akt. In turn, Akt activates multiple downstream targets, most notably the
      mTOR pathway. There is abundant evidence implicating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
      pathway in the development and progression of a variety of tumors
      including hematologic neoplasms. Therefore, this pathway is considered a
      critical target for cancer therapy. We review the regulatory mechanisms of
      the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and the role of this pathway in
      oncogenesis of hematological malignancies.

TI  - Dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt/PKB is counteracted by protein
      kinase CK2 in HEK 293T cells.
PG  - 3363-73
AB  - Akt (PKB) is a critical kinase in cell-survival pathways. Its activity
      depends on the phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473, by PDK1 and mTORC2,
      respectively. We found that Akt can be further stimulated through
      phosphorylation of Ser129 by another kinase, CK2. Here we show that
      phosphorylation of Akt at Ser129 also facilitates its association with
      Hsp90 chaperone, thus preventing Thr308 dephosphorylation. This is
      supported by the following observations: (1) phospho-Thr308 decreases when
      Ser129 is mutated to alanine, (2) this decrease is abolished by cell
      treatment with okadaic acid (to inactivate PP2A) or geldanamycin (to
      inactivate Hsp90), (3) phosphorylation of Ser129 neither enhances the
      activity of PDK1 nor hampers the in vitro activity of PP2A on Thr308, but
      increases the Hsp90 association to Akt. These data support the view that
      the antiapoptotic potential of CK2 is at least in part mediated by its
      ability to maintain Akt in its active form.

TI  - Aging-associated dysfunction of Akt/protein kinase B: S-nitrosylation and
      acetaminophen intervention.
PG  - e6430
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aged skeletal muscle is characterized by an increased
      incidence of metabolic and functional disorders, which if allowed to
      proceed unchecked can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The
      mechanism(s) underlying the development of these disorders in aging
      skeletal muscle are not well understood. Protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) is an
      important regulator of cellular metabolism and survival, but it is unclear
      if aged muscle exhibits alterations in Akt function. Here we report a
      novel dysfunction of Akt in aging muscle, which may relate to
      S-nitrosylation and can be prevented by acetaminophen intervention.
      PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to 6- and 27-month rats, the phosphorylation
      of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308) was higher in soleus muscles of very aged rats
      (33-months). Paradoxically, these increases in Akt phosphorylation were
      associated with diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      phosphorylation, along with decreased levels of insulin receptor beta
      (IR-beta), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin
      homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and phosphorylation of
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) (Ser241). In vitro Akt kinase
      measurements and ex vivo muscle incubation experiments demonstrated
      age-related impairments of Akt kinase activity, which were associated with
      increases in Akt S-nitrosylation and inducible nitric oxide synthase
      (iNOS). Impairments in Akt function occurred parallel to increases in
      myocyte apoptosis and decreases in myocyte size and the expression of
      myosin and actin. These age-related disorders were attenuated by treating
      aged (27-month) animals with acetaminophen (30 mg/kg body weight/day) for
      6-months. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that Akt dysfunction and
      increased S-nitrosylation of Akt may contribute to age-associated
      disorders in skeletal muscle and that acetaminophen may be efficacious for
      the treatment of age-related muscle dysfunction.

AB  - Loss of PTEN causes unregulated activation of downstream components of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, including PDK1, and
      disrupts normal nervous system development and homeostasis. We tested the
      contribution of Pdk1 to the abnormalities induced by Pten deletion in the
      brain. Conditional deletion of Pdk1 caused microcephaly. Combined deletion
      of Pdk1 and Pten rescued hypertrophy, but not migration defects of
      Pten-deficient neurons. Pdk1 inactivation induced strikingly different
      effects on the regulation of phosphorylated Akt in glia versus neurons.
      Our results show Pdk1-dependent and Pdk1-independent abnormalities in
      Pten-deficient brains, and demonstrate cell type specific differences in
      feedback regulation of the ubiquitous PI3K pathway.

TI  - 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 potentiates upstream lesions on the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway in breast carcinoma.
PG  - 6299-306
AB  - Lesions of ERBB2, PTEN, and PIK3CA activate the phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase (PI3K) pathway during cancer development by increasing levels of
      phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)).
      3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is the first node of the PI3K
      signal output and is required for activation of AKT. PIP(3) recruits PDK1
      and AKT to the cell membrane through interactions with their pleckstrin
      homology domains, allowing PDK1 to activate AKT by phosphorylating it at
      residue threonine-308. We show that total PDK1 protein and mRNA were
      overexpressed in a majority of human breast cancers and that 21% of tumors
      had five or more copies of the gene encoding PDK1, PDPK1. We found that
      increased PDPK1 copy number was associated with upstream pathway lesions
      (ERBB2 amplification, PTEN loss, or PIK3CA mutation), as well as patient
      survival. Examination of an independent set of breast cancers and tumor
      cell lines derived from multiple forms of human cancers also found
      increased PDK1 protein levels associated with such upstream pathway
      lesions. In human mammary cells, PDK1 enhanced the ability of upstream
      lesions to signal to AKT, stimulate cell growth and migration, and
      rendered cells more resistant to PDK1 and PI3K inhibition. After
      orthotopic transplantation, PDK1 overexpression was not oncogenic but
      dramatically enhanced the ability of ERBB2 to form tumors. Our studies
      argue that PDK1 overexpression and increased PDPK1 copy number are common
      occurrences in cancer that potentiate the oncogenic effect of upstream
      lesions on the PI3K pathway. Therefore, we conclude that alteration of
      PDK1 is a critical component of oncogenic PI3K signaling in breast cancer.

AB  - The serine/threonine kinase Akt is an effector of PI3K-generated
      phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] and is a
      principle mediator of growth factor-induced signal transduction. Akt is
      activated through phosphorylation by specific kinases, and its activity is
      reduced directly by phosphorylation-site-specific phosphatases. In
      addition, Akt activity is effectively reduced by the action of
      phosphatases which dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3, thereby reducing the
      levels of the essential lipid activators of PDK1 and Akt. The functions of
      Akt are pleiotropic and include regulation of cellular proliferation,
      differentiation, protein synthesis, and survival. Akt stimulates protein
      synthesis through actions on mTOR/p70S6K, and promotes survival by
      phosphorylating and inactivating pro-apoptotic molecules such as Ask1,
      Bad, Bax, and FoxO3a. Furthermore, loss of Akt decreases the intracellular
      ATP:AMP ratio, thus establishing a role for Akt in energy regulation.
      Three isoforms of Akt have been identified, and although redundant
      functions between isoforms exist, recent investigations have enumerated
      unique functions for each. Therefore, targeting specific Akt isozymes in a
      tissue- and context-specific fashion may lead to a greater understanding
      of Akt-mediated processes.

TI  - The nuclear localization of 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 is
      dependent on its association with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1.
PG  - 1634-44
AB  - 3'-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), the direct upstream
      kinase of Akt, can localize to the nucleus during specific signalling
      events. The mechanism used for its import into the nucleus, however,
      remains unresolved as it lacks a canonical nuclear localization signal
      (NLS). Expression of activated Src kinase in C6 glioblastoma cells
      promotes the association of tyrosylphosphorylated PDK1 with the
      NLS-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 as well as the nuclear
      localization of both proteins. A constitutive nucleo-cytoplasmic
      SHP-1:PDK1 shuttling complex is supported by several lines of evidence
      including (i) the distribution of both proteins to similar subcellular
      compartments following manipulation of the nuclear pore complex, (ii) the
      nuclear retention of SHP-1 upon overexpression of a PDK1 protein bearing a
      disrupted nuclear export signal (NES), and (iii) the exclusion of PDK1
      from the nucleus upon overexpression of SHP-1 lacking the NLS or following
      siRNA-mediated knock-down of SHP-1. The latter case results in a
      perinuclear distribution of PDK1 that corresponds with the distribution of
      PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate), while a PDK1 protein
      bearing a mutated PH domain that abrogates PIP3-binding is excluded from
      the nucleus. Our data suggest that the SHP-1:PDK1 complex is recruited to
      the nuclear membrane by binding to perinuclear PIP3, whereupon SHP-1 (and
      its NLS) facilitates active import. Export from the nucleus relies on PDK1
      (and its NES). The intact complex contributes to Src kinase-induced,
      Akt-sensitive podial formation in C6 cells.

AB  - PI3K is an important node regulating the signaling of several essential
      biological processes. PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation in position 3 of
      the inositol ring of phosphatidyl-inositide producing important lipid
      second messengers. The products of PI3K activity recruit PDK1 and AKT
      Ser/Thr kinases to the plasma membrane where they get activated
      transducing a potent proliferative and anti-apoptotic signal to the cell.
      PI3K is activated by growth factors, insulin and GPCR activation.
      Furthermore, PI3K can be activated by direct binding to oncogenic Ras
      proteins. PI3K is commonly altered in human cancers by point activating
      mutations or by amplification. Furthermore, other proteins of the route
      are also altered in human tumors (such as phosphatase and tensin homolog
      in chromosome 10 or human EGF receptor 2) providing constitutive
      activation of PI3K. The evidence indicates that the PI3K pathway is a
      potential target for cancer chemotherapy. Indeed, many companies and
      academic laboratories have initiated a variety of approaches to inhibit
      the PI3K pathway at different points. In this work, we review the
      targeting of PI3K protein for therapeutical intervention.

TI  - Biochemical, cellular, and in vivo activity of novel ATP-competitive and
      selective inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin.
PG  - 6232-40
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is centrally involved in cell
      growth, metabolism, and angiogenesis. While showing clinical efficacy in a
      subset of tumors, rapamycin and rapalogs are specific and allosteric
      inhibitors of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), but they do not directly inhibit
      mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), an emerging player in cancer. Here, we report
      chemical structure and biological characterization of three
      pyrazolopyrimidine ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, WAY-600, WYE-687, and
      WYE-354 (IC(50), 5-9 nmol/L), with significant selectivity over
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) isofoms (>100-fold). Unlike the
      rapalogs, these inhibitors acutely blocked substrate phosphorylation by
      mTORC1 and mTORC2 in vitro and in cells in response to growth factor,
      amino acids, and hyperactive PI3K/AKT. Unlike the inhibitors of PI3K or
      dual-pan PI3K/mTOR, cellular inhibition of P-S6K1(T389) and P-AKT(S473) by
      the pyrazolopyrimidines occurred at significantly lower inhibitor
      concentrations than those of P-AKT(T308) (PI3K-PDK1 readout), showing mTOR
      selectivity in cellular setting. mTOR kinase inhibitors reduced AKT
      downstream function and inhibited proliferation of diverse cancer cell
      lines. These effects correlated with a strong G(1) cell cycle arrest in
      both the rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-resistant cells, selective
      induction of apoptosis, repression of global protein synthesis, and
      down-regulation of angiogenic factors. When injected into tumor-bearing
      mice, WYE-354 inhibited mTORC1 and mTORC2 and displayed robust antitumor
      activity in PTEN-null tumors. Together, our results highlight mechanistic
      differentiation between rapalogs and mTOR kinase inhibitors in targeting
      cancer cell growth and survival and provide support for clinical
      development of mTOR kinase inhibitors as new cancer therapy.

TI  - Gene expression profiling of 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to phloretin.
PG  - 645-52
AB  - Adipocyte dysfunction plays a major role in the outcome of obesity,
      insulin resistance and related cardiovascular complications. Thus,
      considerable efforts are underway in the pharmaceutical industry to find
      molecules that target the now well-documented pleiotropic functions of
      adipocyte. We previously reported that the dietary flavonoid phloretin
      enhances 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and adiponectin expression at
      least in part through PPAR gamma activation. The present study was
      designed to further characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the
      phloretin-mediated effects on 3T3-L1 adipocytes using microarray
      technology. We show that phloretin positively regulates the expression of
      numerous genes involved in lipogenesis and triglyceride storage, including
      GLUT4, ACSL1, PEPCK1, lipin-1 and perilipin (more than twofold). The
      expression of several genes encoding adipokines, in addition to
      adiponectin and its receptor, is positively or negatively regulated in a
      way that suggests a possible reduction in systemic insulin resistance and
      obesity-associated inflammation. Improvement of insulin sensitivity is
      also suggested by the overexpression of genes associated with insulin
      signal transduction, such as CAP, PDK1 and Akt2. Many of these genes are
      PPAR gamma targets, confirming the involvement of PPAR gamma pathway in
      the phloretin effects on adipocytes. In light of these microarray data, it
      is reasonable to assume that phloretin may be beneficial for reducing
      insulin resistance, in a similar way to the thiazolidinedione class of
      antidiabetic drugs.

TI  - AKT-independent signaling downstream of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations in
      human cancer.
PG  - 21-32
AB  - Dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
      pathway occurs frequently in human cancer. PTEN tumor suppressor or PIK3CA
      oncogene mutations both direct PI3K-dependent tumorigenesis largely
      through activation of the AKT/PKB kinase. However, here we show through
      phosphoprotein profiling and functional genomic studies that many PIK3CA
      mutant cancer cell lines and human breast tumors exhibit only minimal AKT
      activation and a diminished reliance on AKT for anchorage-independent
      growth. Instead, these cells retain robust PDK1 activation and membrane
      localization and exhibit dependency on the PDK1 substrate SGK3. SGK3
      undergoes PI3K- and PDK1-dependent activation in PIK3CA mutant cancer
      cells. Thus, PI3K may promote cancer through both AKT-dependent and
      AKT-independent mechanisms. Knowledge of differential PI3K/PDK1 signaling
      could inform rational therapeutics in cancers harboring PIK3CA mutations.

TI  - Proteasome inactivation promotes p38 mitogen-activated protein
      kinase-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and increases
      interleukin-8 production in retinal pigment epithelial cells.
PG  - 3690-9
AB  - Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      many age-related diseases. We have demonstrated previously that oxidative
      inactivation of the proteasome is a molecular link between oxidative
      stress and overexpression of interleukin (IL)-8. Here, we elucidated a
      novel signaling cascade that leads to up-regulation of IL-8 in response to
      proteasome inactivation. The sequence of events in this cascade includes
      proteasome inactivation, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
      kinase (MKK)3/MKK6, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK), epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation,
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and increased IL-8
      expression. Blocking any of these signaling pathways abolished the
      up-regulation of IL-8 induced by proteasome inhibition. Although Akt is
      also activated in response to proteasome inactivation, we found that the
      PI3K-dependent up-regulation of IL-8 is independent of
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)1 and Akt. Inhibition of
      PDK1 and Akt with chemical inhibitors or expression of constitutive active
      Akt had little effects on IL-8 expression in response to proteasome
      inactivation. In contrast, inhibition of interleukin 2-inducible T cell
      kinase, a kinase downstream of PI3K, significantly reduced the expression
      and secretion of IL-8 in response to proteasome inactivation. Together,
      these data elucidate a novel signaling network that leads to increased
      IL-8 production in response to proteasome inactivation.

TI  - TOB suppresses breast cancer tumorigenesis.
PG  - 1805-13
AB  - Transducer of ErbB-2 (TOB) is a member of the TOB/Btg gene family. A role
      for TOB in the suppression of human tumorigenesis has been proposed, based
      on the observations that TOB-knockout mice spontaneously form tumors and
      TOB expression is lost in human lung and thyroid cancers. However, the
      role of TOB in human breast cancer remains unknown. To evaluate the this
      role, we screened a panel of breast cancer cell lines for TOB expression
      levels and found that they are inversely correlated with the
      tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of the cell lines. In addition, we
      demonstrated for the first time that TOB expression is inversely
      correlated with breast cancer progression in clinical specimens. These
      results strongly indicate that the loss of TOB expression plays a role in
      breast cancer progression. We have also provided the first evidence that
      TOB functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer MCF-7 cells, using
      gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches to manipulate TOB
      expression. Cell-cycle analysis further revealed that TOB can prolong the
      G1-S phase transition by inducing arrest at G1-S phase. Moreover,
      upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and
      downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were
      observed in MCF7/TOB transfectants. Conversely, opposite results were
      observed in shRNA-TOB transfectants. Furthermore, decreased activity of
      Erk2, AKT, CrkL, PDK1, and Smads were observed in TOB-overexpressing
      cells. Taken together, these data provide evidence that TOB can function
      as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer through modulation and regulation
      of multiple signaling pathways.

TI  - Raptor binds the SAIN (Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding) domain of insulin
      receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and regulates the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at
      Ser-636/639 by mTOR.
PG  - 22525-34
AB  - In normal physiological states mTOR phosphorylates and activates Akt.
      However, under diabetic-mimicking conditions mTOR inhibits
      phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt signaling by phosphorylating
      insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser-636/639. The molecular basis
      for the differential effect of mTOR signaling on Akt is poorly understood.
      Here, it has been shown that knockdown of mTOR, Raptor, and mLST8, but not
      Rictor and mSin1, suppresses insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1
      at Ser-636/639 and stabilizes IRS-1 after long term insulin stimulation.
      This phosphorylation depends on the PI 3-kinase/PDK1 axis but is
      Akt-independent. At the molecular level, Raptor binds the SAIN (Shc and
      IRS-1 NPXY binding) domain of IRS-1 and regulates the phosphorylation of
      IRS-1 at Ser-636/639 by mTOR. IRS-1 lacking the SAIN domain does not
      interact with Raptor, is not phosphorylated at Ser-636/639, and favorably
      interacts with PI 3-kinase. Overall, these data provide new insights in
      the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 inhibits PI 3-kinase/Akt
      signaling at the level of IRS-1 and suggest that mTOR signaling toward Akt
      is scaffold-dependent.

TI  - Selective induction of neocortical GABAergic neurons by the PDK1-Akt
      pathway through activation of Mash1.
PG  - 13064-9
AB  - Extracellular stimuli regulate neuronal differentiation and subtype
      specification during brain development, although the intracellular
      signaling pathways that mediate these processes remain largely unclear. We
      now show that the PDK1-Akt pathway regulates differentiation of
      telencephalic neural precursor cells (NPCs). Active Akt promotes
      differentiation of NPC into gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing (GABAergic)
      but not glutamatergic neurons. Disruption of the Pdk1 gene or expression
      of dominant-negative forms of Akt suppresses insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF)-1 enhancement of NPC differentiation into neurons in vitro and
      production of neocortical GABAergic neurons in vivo. Furthermore, active
      Akt increased the protein levels and transactivation activity of Mash1, a
      proneural basic helix-loop-helix protein required for the generation of
      neocortical GABAergic neurons, and Mash1 was required for Akt-induced
      neuronal differentiation. These results have unveiled an unexpected role
      of the PDK1-Akt pathway: a key mediator of extracellular signals
      regulating the production of neocortical GABAergic neurons.

TI  - Down-regulation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 levels
      inhibits migration and experimental metastasis of human breast cancer
      cells.
PG  - 944-54
AB  - High expression of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)
      has been detected in various invasive cancers. In the current study, we
      investigated its role in cancer cell migration and experimental
      metastasis. Down-regulation of PDK1 expression by small interference RNA
      markedly inhibited spontaneous migration and epidermal growth factor
      (EGF)-induced chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells. The defects were
      rescued by expressing wild-type PDK1. PDK1-depleted cells showed impaired
      EGF-induced actin polymerization and adhesion, probably due to a decrease
      in phosphorylation of LIM kinase/cofilin and integrin beta1. Confocal
      microscopy revealed that EGF induced cotranslocation of PDK1 with Akt and
      protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta), regulators of LIM kinase, and integrin
      beta1. Furthermore, PDK1 depletion dampened EGF-induced phosphorylation
      and translocation of Akt and PKCzeta, suggesting that Akt and PKCzeta
      functioned downstream of PDK1 in the chemotactic signaling pathway. In
      severe combined immunodeficiency mice, PDK1-depleted human breast cancer
      cells formed more slowly growing tumors and were defective in
      extravasation to mouse lungs after i.v. injection. Our results indicate
      that PDK1 plays an important role in regulating the malignant behavior of
      breast cancer cells, including their motility, through activation of Akt
      and PKCzeta. Thus, PDK1, which increases its expression in cancer cells,
      can be used as a target for the development of novel therapies.

TI  - A chimeric mechanism for polyvalent trans-phosphorylation of PKA by PDK1.
PG  - 1486-97
AB  - Phosphorylation on the activation loop of AGC kinases is typically
      mediated by PDK1. The precise mechanism for this in-trans phosphorylation
      is unknown; however, docking of a hydrophobic (HF) motif in the C-tail of
      the substrate kinase onto the N-lobe of PDK1 is likely an essential step.
      Using a peptide array of PKA to identify other PDK1-interacting sites, we
      discovered a second AGC-conserved motif in the C-tail that interacts with
      PDK1. Since this motif [FD(X)(1-2)Y/F] lies in the active site tether
      region and in PKA contributes to ATP binding, we call it the Adenosine
      binding (Ade) motif. The Ade motif is conserved as a PDK1-interacting site
      in Akt and PRK2, and we predict it will be a PDK1-interacting site for
      most AGC kinases. In PKA, the HF motif is only recognized when the turn
      motif Ser338 is phosphorylated, possibly serving as a phosphorylation
      "switch" that regulates how the Ade and HF motifs interact with PDK1.
      These results demonstrate that the extended AGC C-tail serves as a
      polyvalent element that trans-regulates PDK1 for catalysis. Modeling of
      the PKA C-tail onto PDK1 structure creates two chimeric sites; the ATP
      binding pocket, which is completed by the Ade motif, and the C-helix,
      which is positioned by the HF motif. Together, they demonstrate
      substrate-assisted catalysis involving two kinases that have co-evolved as
      symbiotic partners. The highly regulated turn motifs are the most variable
      part of the AGC C-tail. Elucidating the highly regulated cis and trans
      functions of the AGC tail is a significant future challenge.

TI  - A forward genetic screen in Drosophila implicates insulin signaling in
      age-related locomotor impairment.
PG  - 532-40
AB  - Age-related locomotor impairment (ARLI) is one of the most detrimental
      changes that occurs during aging. Elderly individuals with ARLI are at
      increased risks for falls, depression and a number of other
      co-morbidities. Despite its clinical significance, little is known about
      the genes that influence ARLI. We consequently performed a forward genetic
      screen to identify Drosophila strains with delayed ARLI using negative
      geotaxis as an index of locomotor function. One of the delayed ARLI
      strains recovered from the screen had a P-element insertion that decreased
      expression of the insulin signaling gene phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
      1 (PDK1) Precise excision of the P-element insertion reverted PDK1
      expression and ARLI to the same as control flies, indicating that
      disruption of PDK1 leads to delayed ARLI. Follow-up studies showed that
      additional loss of function mutations in PDK1 as well as loss of function
      alleles of two other insulin signaling genes, Dp110 and Akt (the genes for
      the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and AKT), also
      forestalled ARLI. Interestingly, only some of the strains with delayed
      ARLI had elevated resistance to paraquat, indicating that enhanced
      resistance to this oxidative stressor is not required for preservation of
      locomotor function across age. Our studies implicate insulin signaling as
      a key regulator of ARLI in Drosophila.

PG  - 2646-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in the expression and phosphorylation of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt protein kinases controlling
      survival and/or apoptosis of in vitro cell cultures of uterine leiomyomas.
      DESIGN: Establishment of paired cell cultures of leiomyoma and myometrial
      specimens. SETTING: Hadassah gynecology research laboratory. PATIENT(S):
      Eleven white premenopausal women, 35 to 50 years of age, undergoing
      hysterectomy because of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas. INTERVENTION(S):
      None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Immunochemical analysis of expression and
      phosphorylation of relevant PI3K/Akt and BCL2 proteins. RESULT(S):
      Analysis of total phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
      10 (PTEN) and of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated (p) PDK1, Akt,
      glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), FKHR, tuberin (TSC2) and hamartin
      (TSC1) complex, and cyclin D2 proteins indicated that [1] the level of
      pGSK3alpha and cyclin D2 proteins was elevated significantly in the
      leiomyoma compared with the normal myometrium, [2] there was a significant
      interaction between PTEN- PDK1 and between pAkt-pGSK3beta in the leiomyoma
      compared with the myometrial cells, and [3] there was a significant
      interaction between pAkt-pGSK3alpha in the paired leiomyoma and myometrial
      cultures. CONCLUSION(S): Our study suggests that the downstream signaling

TI  - Inhibition of superoxide anion generation by CHS-111 via blockade of the
      p21-activated kinase, protein kinase B/Akt and protein kinase C signaling
      pathways in rat neutrophils.
PG  - 207-17
AB  - In formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-stimulated rat neutrophils,
      2-benzyl-3-(4-hydroxymethylphenyl)indazole (CHS-111) inhibited superoxide
      anion (O(2)(-)) generation, which was not mediated by scavenging the
      generated O(2)(-) or by a cytotoxic effect, and attenuated migration.
      CHS-111 had no effect on the arachidonic acid-induced NADPH oxidase
      activation or the GTPgammaS-stimulated Rac2 membrane translocation in
      cell-free systems, whereas it effectively attenuated the membrane
      recruitment of p40(phox), p47(phox) and p67(phox), phosphorylation of Ser
      residues in p47(phox), association between p47(phox) and p22(phox), and
      Rac activation in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. Moreover, the
      phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of p21-activated kinase (PAK),
      PAK kinase activity and the interaction of PAK with p47(phox) were
      inhibited by CHS-111. CHS-111 effectively reduced Akt kinase activity and
      the association between Akt and p47(phox), moderately inhibited the
      membrane recruitment of Akt and phospho-PDK1, and slightly attenuated Akt
      (Thr308) phosphorylation, whereas it had no effect on Akt (Ser473)
      phosphorylation or p110gamma membrane translocation. The membrane
      recruitment of protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha, -betaI, -betaII, -delta and
      -zeta, PKC phosphorylation and PKC kinase activity was attenuated by
      CHS-111, whereas CHS-111 did not affect the phosphorylation of p38
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or downstream MAPK-activated
      protein kinase-2. Higher concentrations of CHS-111 were required to
      decrease fMLP-stimulated intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration
      ([Ca(2+)](i)) elevation in the presence but not in the absence of
      extracellular Ca(2+), and to reduce cellular cyclic AMP but slightly
      increase cyclic GMP levels. Taken together, these results suggest that
      CHS-111 inhibits fMLP-stimulated O(2)(-) generation in rat neutrophils
      through the blockade of PAK, Akt and PKC signaling pathways.

TI  - PDK1 signaling in oocytes controls reproductive aging and lifespan by
      manipulating the survival of primordial follicles.
PG  - 2813-24
AB  - The molecular mechanisms that control reproductive aging and menopausal
      age in females are poorly understood. Here, we provide genetic evidence
      that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) signaling in
      oocytes preserves reproductive lifespan by maintaining the survival of
      ovarian primordial follicles. In mice lacking the PDK1-encoding gene Pdk1
      in oocytes, the majority of primordial follicles are depleted around the
      onset of sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during
      early adulthood. We further showed that suppressed PDK1-Akt-p70 S6 kinase
      1 (S6K1)-ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) signaling in oocytes appears to be
      responsible for the loss of primordial follicles, and mice lacking the
      Rps6 gene in oocytes show POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. In
      combination with our earlier finding that phosphatase and tensin homolog
      deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in oocytes suppresses follicular
      activation, we have now pinpointed the molecular network involving
      phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/PTEN-PDK1 signaling in oocytes that
      controls the survival, loss and activation of primordial follicles, which
      together determine reproductive aging and the length of reproductive life
      in females. Underactivation or overactivation of this signaling pathway in
      oocytes is shown to cause pathological conditions in the ovary, including
      POF and infertility.

TI  - Ku-0063794 is a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR).
PG  - 29-42
AB  - mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) stimulates cell growth by
      phosphorylating and promoting activation of AGC (protein kinase A/protein
      kinase G/protein kinase C) family kinases such as Akt (protein kinase B),
      S6K (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase) and SGK (serum and glucocorticoid protein
      kinase). mTORC1 (mTOR complex-1) phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of
      S6K, whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Akt and SGK.
      In the present paper we describe the small molecule Ku-0063794, which
      inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with an IC50 of approximately 10 nM, but
      does not suppress the activity of 76 other protein kinases or seven lipid
      kinases, including Class 1 PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases) at 1000-fold
      higher concentrations. Ku-0063794 is cell permeant, suppresses activation
      and hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Akt, S6K and SGK, but not RSK
      (ribosomal S6 kinase), an AGC kinase not regulated by mTOR. Ku-0063794
      also inhibited phosphorylation of the T-loop Thr308 residue of Akt
      phosphorylated by PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1). We
      interpret this as implying phosphorylation of Ser473 promotes
      phosphorylation of Thr308 and/or induces a conformational change that
      protects Thr308 from dephosphorylation. In contrast, Ku-0063794 does not
      affect Thr308 phosphorylation in fibroblasts lacking essential mTORC2
      subunits, suggesting that signalling processes have adapted to enable
      Thr308 phosphorylation to occur in the absence of Ser473 phosphorylation.
      We found that Ku-0063794 induced a much greater dephosphorylation of the
      mTORC1 substrate 4E-BP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein
      1) than rapamycin, even in mTORC2-deficient cells, suggesting a form of
      mTOR distinct from mTORC1, or mTORC2 phosphorylates 4E-BP1. Ku-0063794
      also suppressed cell growth and induced a G1-cell-cycle arrest. Our
      results indicate that Ku-0063794 will be useful in delineating the
      physiological roles of mTOR and may have utility in treatment of cancers
      in which this pathway is inappropriately activated.

TI  - Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway early during vaccinia and cowpox virus
      infections is required for both host survival and viral replication.
PG  - 6883-99
AB  - Viral manipulation of the transduction pathways associated with key
      cellular functions such as actin remodeling, microtubule stabilization,
      and survival may favor a productive viral infection. Here we show that
      consistent with the vaccinia virus (VACV) and cowpox virus (CPXV)
      requirement for cytoskeleton alterations early during the infection cycle,
      PBK/Akt was phosphorylated at S473 [Akt(S473-P)], a modification
      associated with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2),
      which was paralleled by phosphorylation at T308 [Akt(T308-P)] by
      PI3K/PDK1, which is required for host survival. Notably, while VACV
      stimulated Akt(S473-P/T308-P) at early (1 h postinfection [p.i.]) and late
      (24 h p.i.) times during the infective cycle, CPXV stimulated Akt at early
      times only. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PI3K (LY294002) or
      Akt (Akt-X and a dominant-negative form of Akt-K179M) resulted in a
      significant decline in virus yield (from 80% to >/=90%). This decline was
      secondary to the inhibition of late viral gene expression, which in turn
      led to an arrest of virion morphogenesis at the immature-virion stage of
      the viral growth cycle. Furthermore, the cleavage of both caspase-3 and
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase-mediated deoxyuridine nick end labeling assays confirmed that
      permissive, spontaneously immortalized cells such as A31 cells and mouse
      embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) underwent apoptosis upon orthopoxvirus
      infection plus LY294002 treatment. Thus, in A31 cells and MEFs, early
      viral receptor-mediated signals transmitted via the PI3K/Akt pathway are
      required and precede the expression of viral antiapoptotic genes.
      Additionally, the inhibition of these signals resulted in the apoptosis of
      the infected cells and a significant decline in viral titers.

TI  - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF receptor expression and
      function in folliculostellate pituitary cells.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - Homo- and heterodimers of platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) and
      PDGF-B chains are involved through PDGF alpha- and beta-receptors in the
      growth regulation of multiple normal and tumoural cell types as well as in
      tumour neovascularization. Since little information is available on the
      impact of PDGF/PDGF receptors in normal and adenomatous pituitary, we
      studied the expression and action of this growth factor system in a
      variety of pituitary tumour cell lines and in rat anterior pituitary cell
      cultures. By RT-PCR, mRNA expression of PDGF-A and -B chains and of both
      receptors was found in rat pituitary and mouse folliculostellate TtT/GF
      pituitary tumour cells. Rat somatotroph MtT-S and mouse corticotroph AtT20
      tumor cells expressed only a part of the PDGF/PDGF receptor components
      whereas mouse gonadotroph alphaT3-1 and rat lactosomatotroph GH3 pituitary
      tumour cells contained neither PDGF nor PDGF receptors. To further
      characterize the role of PDGF in TtT/GF cells, the effect of PDGF-AB and
      -BB on growth and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) release
      was studied. Proliferation of TtT/GF cells was weakly but significantly
      stimulated by PDGF. Both in rat pituitary cell cultures and in TtT/GF
      cells, PDGF-AB and -BB strongly enhanced VEGF-A secretion. The PI3 kinase
      inhibitor LY 294002 blocked the increase in VEGF-A. Western immunoblotting
      confirmed the participation of key components of the PI3 kinase/Akt signal
      pathway (PDK1, Akt-Ser476) in PDGF-stimulated VEGF production. Thus the
      PDGF/PDGF receptor system is expressed in folliculostellate cells and is
      involved in VEGF regulation. Its role in endocrine pituitary tumour cell
      lines and pituitary adenomas need to be clarified in future studies.

TI  - Pi3K-mTOR signaling and AMOG expression in epilepsy-associated
      glioneuronal tumors.
PG  - 234-44
AB  - Gangliogliomas (GGs) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs)
      represent the most frequent type of neoplasms in pediatric medically
      intractable epilepsy. Several data suggest a pathogenetic relationship
      between GGs and other glioneuronal malformations of cortical development
      (MCDs), including activation of the Pi3K-mTOR signaling pathway. To
      further reveal these pathogenetic similarities, we investigated
      immunocytochemically the expression of phosphorylated (p)-PDK1, p-AKT,
      p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, p-eIF4G, p-p70S6K and p-S6, the effector proteins ERM
      (ezrin/radixin/moesin) and the pathway regulator AMOG (adhesion molecule
      on glia) in both GGs and DNTs. Components of the Pi3K-mTOR signaling
      pathway were observed in a higher percentage of neuronal cells in GGs
      compared with control cortex. In DNTs, the expression of these components
      was low and comparable with the expression in control samples. Strong
      immunoreactivity for ERM was observed in GGs, but not in DNTs.
      Additionally, AMOG was strongly expressed within GGs (but not in DNTs) in
      CD34-positive precursor cells. These findings support the previously
      suggested pathogenic relationship between GG and MCDs concerning
      activation of the Pi3K-mTOR signaling pathway and suggest a different
      pathogenetic origin for DNTs. The strong expression of AMOG within the
      precursor cells of GG may represent an additional marker for the
      diagnostic evaluation of these glioneuronal lesions.

TI  - Contribution of natural inhibitors to the understanding of the
      PI3K/PDK1/PKB pathway in the insulin-mediated intracellular signaling
      cascade.
PG  - 2217-30
AB  - The critical initial steps in insulin action include phosphorylation of
      adapter proteins and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).
      One of important components in this process is a protein called
      Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). The work of numerous different researchers
      indicates a role of PKB in regulating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.
      The crucial role of lipid second messengers in PKB activation has been
      dissected through the use of the PI3K-specific inhibitors wortmannin and
      LY294002. Receptor-activated PI3K synthesizes the lipid second messenger
      PtdIns[3,4,5]-trisphosphate, leading to the recruitment of PKB to the
      membrane. Membrane attachment of PKB is mediated by its pleckstrin
      homology domain binding to PtdIns[3,4,5]-trisphosphate or
      PtdIns[3,4]-bisphosphate with high affinity. Activation of PKB alpha is
      then achieved at the plasma membrane by phosphorylation of Thr308 in the
      activation-loop of the kinase domain and Ser473 in the carboxy-terminal
      regulatory region, respectively. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase-1 (PDK1) is responsible for T308 phosphorylation. The usage of
      specific inhibitors and natural compound has significantly contributed to
      investigate the molecular mechanism of PI3K/PDK1/PKB signaling pathway,
      leading to the putative therapeutics benefits of patients. This review
      focuses on the contribution of natural inhibitor or compound in our
      understanding of the mechanism by which insulin induces, especially in
      PI3K/PDK1/PKB signaling.

TI  - Proteomic and phosphoproteomic alterations in benign, premalignant and
      tumor human breast epithelial cells and xenograft lesions: biomarkers of
      progression.
PG  - 2813-28
AB  - The MCF10A human breast epithelial cell lineage includes the benign MCF10A
      cells, premalignant cells (MCF10AT, MCF10ATG3B) and malignant MCF10CA1a
      tumor cells. The premalignant and tumor cells recapitulate the progressive
      alterations associated with the temporal development of PBD and carcinoma.
      Ras protein levels were elevated by 6.9-, 22.4- and 32.2-fold in 10AT,
      10ATG3B and 10CA1a cells, respectively, relative to 10A cells. K-Ras was
      not detected, N-Ras levels were unchanged; Rac and Rho levels increased in
      10CA1a tumor cells. Phospho-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
      phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), phospho-PDK1,
      phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and
      phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) levels
      progressively increased in the cell lineage, with the greatest increase
      monitored in 10CA1a tumor cells. Phospho Ser 473 and Thr 408 Akt levels
      increased 10.2- and 136-fold in 10CA1a cells, respectively, relative to
      10A cells. Phospho-p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) increased >2-fold in 10CA1a
      cells, relative to 10A cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed Ras,
      phospho-Akt and phospho-p70S6K (Thr 421/ Ser 424) expression in lesions
      arising from premalignant and tumor cells. FOXO 1, phospho-FOXO 1 and
      phospho-FOXO 4 were significantly elevated in 10ATG3B premalignant and
      10CA1a tumor cells. Phospho-FOXO 3a was progressively elevated, with the
      greatest levels detected in 10CA1a tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry
      revealed that phospho-FOXO 1, 3a and 4 staining was less in benign
      lesions, but elevated in advanced 10ATG3B and malignant 10CA1a lesions,
      showing a correspondence between the cells and lesions. Hence, phospho-Akt
      and phospho-FOXO 1, 3a and 4 merit consideration as biomarkers of
      tumorigenic risk from hyperplastic breast tissue.

TI  - Cardioprotective stimuli mediate phosphoinositide 3-kinase and
      phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 nuclear accumulation in
      cardiomyocytes.
PG  - 96-103
AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1
      (PDK1) signaling pathway exerts cardioprotective effects in the myocardium
      through activation of key proteins including Akt. Activated Akt
      accumulates in nuclei of cardiomyocytes suggesting that biologically
      relevant targets are located in that subcellular compartment. Nuclear Akt
      activity could be potentiated in both intensity and duration by the
      presence of a nuclear-associated PI3K/PDK1 signaling cascade as has been
      described in other non-myocyte cell types. PI3K/PDK1 distribution was
      determined in vitro and in vivo by immunostaining and nuclear extraction
      of cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes or transgenic mouse hearts.
      Results show that PI3K and PDK1 are present at a basal level in
      cardiomyocytes nuclei and that cardioprotective stimulation with atrial
      natriuretic peptide (ANP) increases their nuclear localization. In
      comparison, overexpression of nuclear-targeted Akt does not mediate
      increased translocation of either PI3K or PDK1 indicating that
      accumulation of Akt does not drive PI3K or PDK1 into the nuclear
      compartment. Furthermore, PI3K and phospho-Akt(473) show parallel temporal
      accumulation in the nucleus following (MI) infarction challenge. These
      findings demonstrate the presence of a dynamically regulated
      nuclear-associated signaling cascade involving PI3K and PDK that
      presumably influences nuclear Akt activation.

TI  - c-Src regulates Akt signaling in response to ghrelin via beta-arrestin
      signaling-independent and -dependent mechanisms.
PG  - e4686
AB  - The aim of the present study was to identify the signaling mechanisms to
      ghrelin-stimulated activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. In human
      embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transfected with GHS-R1a, ghrelin
      leads to the activation of Akt through the interplay of distinct signaling
      mechanisms: an early G(i/o) protein-dependent pathway and a late pathway
      mediated by beta-arrestins. The starting point is the G(i/o)-protein
      dependent PI3K activation that leads to the membrane recruitment of Akt,
      which is phosphorylated at Y by c-Src with the subsequent phosphorylation
      at A-loop (T308) and HM (S473) by PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. Once the
      receptor is activated, a second signaling pathway is mediated by
      beta-arrestins 1 and 2, involving the recruitment of at least
      beta-arrestins, c-Src and Akt. This beta-arrestin-scaffolded complex leads
      to full activation of Akt through PDK1 and mTORC2, which are not
      associated to the complex. In agreement with these results, assays
      performed in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells indicate that beta-arrestins and
      c-Src are implicated in the activation of Akt in response to ghrelin
      through the GHS-R1a. In summary this work reveals that c-Src is crucially
      involved in the ghrelin-mediated Akt activation. Furthermore, the results
      support the view that beta-arrestins act as both scaffolding proteins and
      signal transducers on Akt activation.

TI  - Functional involvement of protein kinase C-betaII and its substrate,
      myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), in
      insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells.
PG  - 901-11
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin stimulates phosphorylation cascades, including
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatidylinositol-dependent
      kinase (PDK1), Akt, and protein kinase C (PKC). Myristoylated alanine-rich
      C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), a PKCbetaII substrate, could link the effects
      of insulin to insulin-stimulated glucose transport (ISGT) via
      phosphorylation of its effector domain since MARCKS has a role in
      cytoskeletal rearrangements. METHODS: We examined phosphoPKCbetaII after
      insulin treatment of L6 myocytes, and cytosolic and membrane
      phosphoMARCKS, MARCKS and phospholipase D1 in cells pretreated with
      LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), CG53353 (PKCbetaII inhibitor) or W13
      (calmodulin inhibitor), PI3K, PKCbetaII and calmodulin inhibitors,
      respectively, before insulin treatment, using western blots. ISGT was
      examined after cells had been treated with inhibitors, small inhibitory
      RNA (siRNA) for MARCKS, or transfection with MARCKS mutated at a PKC site.
      MARCKS, PKCbetaII, GLUT4 and insulin receptor were immunoblotted in
      subcellular fractions with F-actin antibody immunoprecipitates to
      demonstrate changes following insulin treatment. GLUT4 membrane insertion
      was followed after insulin with or without CG53353. RESULTS: Insulin
      increased phosphoPKCbetaII(Ser660 and Thr641); LY294002 blocked this,
      indicating its activation by PI3K. Insulin treatment increased cytosolic
      phosphoMARCKS, decreased membrane MARCKS and increased membrane
      phospholipase D1 (PLD1), a protein regulating glucose transporter vesicle
      fusion resulted. PhosphoMARCKS was attenuated by CG53353 or MARCKS siRNA.
      MARCKS siRNA blocked ISGT. Association of PKCbetaII and GLUT4 with
      membrane F-actin was enhanced by insulin, as was that of cytosolic and
      membrane MARCKS. ISGT was attenuated in myocytes transfected with mutated
      MARCKS (Ser152Ala), whereas overproduction of wild-type MARCKS enhanced
      ISGT. CG53353 blocked insertion of GLUT4 into membranes of insulin treated
      cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that PKCbetaII is
      involved in mediating downstream steps of ISGT through MARCKS
      phosphorylation and cytoskeletal remodelling.

TI  - Role of a novel PH-kinase domain interface in PKB/Akt regulation:
      structural mechanism for allosteric inhibition.
PG  - e17
AB  - Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) belongs to the AGC superfamily of related
      serine/threonine protein kinases. It is a key regulator downstream of
      various growth factors and hormones and is involved in malignant
      transformation and chemo-resistance. Full-length PKB protein has not been
      crystallised, thus studying the molecular mechanisms that are involved in
      its regulation in relation to its structure have not been simple.
      Recently, the dynamics between the inactive and active conformer at the
      molecular level have been described. The maintenance of PKB's inactive
      state via the interaction of the PH and kinase domains prevents its
      activation loop to be phosphorylated by its upstream activator,
      phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). By using a
      multidisciplinary approach including molecular modelling, classical
      biochemical assays, and Forster resonance energy transfer
      (FRET)/two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), a
      detailed model depicting the interaction between the different domains of
      PKB in its inactive conformation was demonstrated. These findings in turn
      clarified the molecular mechanism of PKB inhibition by AKT inhibitor VIII
      (a specific allosteric inhibitor) and illustrated at the molecular level
      its selectivity towards different PKB isoforms. Furthermore, these
      findings allude to the possible function of the C-terminus in sustaining
      the inactive conformer of PKB. This study presents essential insights into
      the quaternary structure of PKB in its inactive conformation. An
      understanding of PKB structure in relation to its function is critical for
      elucidating its mode of activation and discovering how to modulate its
      activity. The molecular mechanism of inhibition of PKB activation by the
      specific drug AKT inhibitor VIII has critical implications for determining
      the mechanism of inhibition of other allosteric inhibitors and for opening
      up opportunities for the design of new generations of modulator drugs.

PG  - 307-43
AB  - Lipids are actively involved in many cellular processes. Their roles pivot
      toward determining membrane structure, compartment targeting, and membrane
      fusion but also regulation of cell signaling via their interactions with
      proteins and the production of second messengers. As they play a key role
      in cell signaling, the study of protein-protein interaction and protein
      conformation change in relationship with their interaction with lipids is
      of major importance. Until recently, the ability to detect in situ and in
      real time the dynamics of various biological events and signals without
      perturbing the cellular environment has been a real challenge. However,
      the emergence of fluorescence imaging of cells and tissues has allowed the
      dynamic aspects of the cell to be investigated in a more physiological
      context than the disassembled model systems employed in traditional
      biochemical analysis. This chapter highlights some of the many biological
      applications and uses of frequency- and time-domain fluorescence lifetime
      imaging microscopy (FLIM) applied to the detection of Forster resonance
      energy transfer (FRET). The first part describes a FRET system, the second
      part discusses its study by FLIM, and the third part describes the
      application of these methods to a panel of biological questions such as
      (1) spatio-temporal interaction of protein kinase B (PKB) with
      3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), (2) PKB conformation
      change, (3) dynamics of PKB activation, (4) interaction of
      phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) and phospholipase D (PLD)
      with lipids.

TI  - Obestatin stimulates Akt signalling in gastric cancer cells through
      beta-arrestin-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation.
PG  - 599-611
AB  - Obestatin was identified as a gut peptide encoded by the ghrelin gene that
      interacts with the G protein-coupled receptor, GPR39. In this work, a
      sequential analysis of its transmembrane signalling pathway has been
      undertaken to characterize the intracellular mechanisms responsible for
      Akt activation. The results show that Akt activation requires the
      phosphorylation of T308 in the A-loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase 1 (PDK1) and S473 within the HM by the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) kinase complex 2 (mTORC2: Rictor, mLST8, mSin1, mTOR
      kinase) with participation neither of G(i)(/o)-protein nor Gbetagamma
      dimers. Obestatin induces the association of GPR39/beta-arrestin 1/Src
      signalling complex resulting in the transactivation of the epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream Akt signalling. Upon
      administration of obestatin, phosphorylation of mTOR (S2448) and p70S6K1
      (T389) rise with a time course that parallels that of Akt activation.
      Based on the experimental data obtained, a signalling pathway involving a
      beta-arrestin 1 scaffolding complex and EGFR to activate Akt signalling is
      proposed.

TI  - Cardiac regulation by phosphoinositide 3-kinases and PTEN.
PG  - 250-60
AB  - The diverse effects mediated by PI3K/PTEN (phosphoinositide
      3-kinase/phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10)
      signalling in the heart clearly support an important biological and
      pathophysiological role for this signalling cascade. PI3Ks are a family of
      evolutionarily conserved lipid kinases that mediate many cellular
      responses to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. Class I PI3K
      can be activated by either receptor tyrosine kinase/cytokine receptor
      activation (class IA) or G-protein-coupled receptors (class IB), leading
      to the generation of phosphatidyl inositol (3,4,5)P3 and recruitment and
      activation of Akt/protein kinase B, 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1
      (PDK1), or monomeric G-proteins, and phosphorylation of a wide range of
      downstream targets including glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta),
      mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), p70S6 kinase, endothelial nitric
      oxide synthase, and several anti-apoptotic effectors. Class IA (PI3Kalpha,
      beta, and delta) and class IB (PI3Kgamma) PI3Ks mediate distinct
      phenotypes in the heart under negative control by the 3'-lipid phosphatase
      PTEN, which dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to generate PtdIns(4,5)P2.
      PI3Kalpha, PI3Kgamma, and PTEN are expressed in cardiomyocytes,
      fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells, where
      they modulate cell survival, hypertrophy, contractility, metabolism, and
      mechanotransduction. The PI3K/PTEN signalling pathways are involved in a
      wide variety of diseases including myocardial hypertrophy and
      contractility, heart failure, and preconditioning. In this review, we
      discuss the signalling pathways mediated by PI3K class I isoforms and PTEN
      and their roles in cardiac structure and function.

TI  - PKCdelta survival signaling in cells containing an activated p21Ras
      protein requires PDK1.
PG  - 502-8
AB  - Protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) modulates cell survival and apoptosis in
      diverse cellular systems. We recently reported that PKCdelta functions as
      a critical anti-apoptotic signal transducer in cells containing activated
      p21(Ras) and results in the activation of AKT, thereby promoting cell
      survival. How PKCdelta is regulated by p21(Ras), however, remains
      incompletely understood. In this study, we show that PKCdelta, as a
      transducer of anti-apoptotic signals, is activated by phosphotidylinositol
      3' kinase/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PI(3)K-PDK1) to deliver the
      survival signal to Akt in the environment of activated p21(Ras). PDK1 is
      upregulated in cells containing an activated p21Ras. Knock-down of PDK1,
      PKCdelta, or AKT forces cells containing activated p21(Ras) to undergo
      apoptosis. PDK1 regulates PKCdelta activity, and constitutive expression
      of PDK1 increases PKCdelta activity in different cell types. Conversely,
      expression of a kinase-dead (dominant-negative) PDK1 significantly
      suppresses PKCdelta activity. p21(Ras)-mediated survival signaling is
      therefore regulated by via a PI(3)K-AKT pathway, which is dependent upon
      both PDK1 and PKCdelta, and PDK1 activates and regulates PKCdelta to
      determine the fate of cells containing a mutated, activated p21(Ras).

TI  - Resveratrol inhibits the mTOR mitogenic signaling evoked by oxidized LDL
      in smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 126-34
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is a major feature in
      atherosclerosis, since it contributes to the formation of the fibrous cap,
      thus to plaque stability, but also to arterial stenosis and
      post-angioplasty restenosis. Among the various mitogenic signaling
      pathways involved in SMC proliferation, the mTOR pathway regulates both
      the cell cycle and cell growth. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound from
      grapes and red wine, has potential anti-atherogenic and anti-cancer
      properties. This work was designed to investigate the activation of the
      mTOR pathway by the proatherogenic oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in SMC, and the
      potential inhibitory effect of resveratrol. RESULTS: mTOR and its
      downstream target p70S6 kinase are phosphorylated and activated by
      mitogenic concentrations of oxLDL (50 microg/ml), and are involved in SMC
      proliferation, as assessed by the inhibitory effect of the mTOR inhibitor
      rapamycin. The activation of mTOR signaling by oxLDL, requires the
      upstream activation of PI3K and Akt, as assessed by the inhibitory effect
      of the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 on mTOR activation and DNA synthesis.
      Resveratrol blocked the oxLDL-induced phosphorylation and activation of
      the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and strongly inhibited both the DNA
      synthesis and proliferation of SMC. This activity is independent of the
      anti-oxidant effect and of AMPK activation by resveratrol. CONCLUSION:
      These data indicate that the mTOR pathway is activated by oxLDL via
      PI3K/PDK1/Akt, and is required for SMC proliferation. Resveratrol blocks
      specifically this pathway, thereby inhibiting oxLDL-induced SMC
      proliferation. These data highlight a new property for resveratrol that
      could contribute to the general anti-atherogenic properties of this
      polyphenol.

TI  - Mechanisms of sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced akt-dependent smooth muscle
      cell migration.
PG  - 34-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) is a bioactive sphingolipid
      released from activated platelets that stimulates migration of vascular
      smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro. S-1-P will activate akt, which can
      regulate multiple cellular functions including cell migration. Akt
      activation is downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K) and
      phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). The objective of this
      study was to examine the regulation of akt signaling during smooth muscle
      cell (SMC) migration in response to S-1-P. METHODS: Murine arterial SMC
      were cultured in vitro. Linear wound and microchemotaxis assays of
      migration in Boyden chambers were performed in the presence of S-1-P with
      and without an akt inhibitor (aktI). Assays were performed for PI3-K,
      PDK1, akt, and GSK3beta in the presence of various inhibitors and after
      transfection with the G beta gamma inhibitor beta ARK(CT). RESULTS: S-1-P
      induced time-dependent PI3-K, PDK1, and akt activation. The migratory
      responses in both assays to S-1-P were blocked by aktI. Activation of akt
      and dephosphorylation of its downstream kinase, GSK3 beta, were inhibited
      by aktI. Inhibition of PI3-K with LY294002 significantly decreased
      activation of both PI3-K and akt. Inhibition of G beta gamma inhibited akt
      activation through a decrease in activation of both PI3-K and PDK1.
      Although inhibition of the ras with manumycin A had no effect, inhibition
      of rho with C3 limited activation of both PI3K and akt. PDK1 responses
      were unchanged by inhibition of GTPases. Inhibiting the generation of
      reactive oxygen species with N-acetylcysteine and of epidermal growth
      factor receptor with AG1478 inhibited PDK1 activation in response to
      S-1-P. CONCLUSION: S-1-P-mediated migration is akt-dependent.
      S-1-P-mediated akt phosphorylation is controlled by a G beta
      gamma-dependent PI3-K activation, which requires the GTPase rho and G beta
      gamma. PDK1 activation requires G beta gamma-dependent generation of
      reactive oxygen species and epidermal growth factor receptor activation.

TI  - The survival pathways phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
      (PI3-K)/phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt modulate
      liver regeneration through hepatocyte size rather than proliferation.
PG  - 204-14
AB  - Liver regeneration comprises a series of complicated processes. The
      current study was designed to investigate the roles of
      phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)-associated pathways in
      liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) using liver-specific
      Pdk1-knockout (L-Pdk1KO) and Pdk1/STAT3 double KO (L-DKO) mice. There was
      no liver regeneration, and 70% PH was lethal in L-Pdk1KO mice. Liver
      regeneration was severely impaired equally in L-Pdk1KO and L-DKO mice,
      even after nonlethal 30% PH. There was no cell growth (measured as
      increase of cell size) after hepatectomy in L-Pdk1KO mice, although the
      post-PH mitotic response was the same as in controls. As expected,
      hepatectomy did not induce hepatic Akt-phosphorylation (Thr308) in
      L-Pdk1KO mice, and post-PH phosphorylation of Akt, mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70(S6K)), and S6 were also
      reduced. To examine the specific role of PDK1-associated signals, a
      "pif-pocket" mutant of PDK1, which allows PDK1 only to phosphorylate Akt,
      was used. Liver regeneration was recovered in L-Pdk1KO mice with a
      "pif-pocket" mutant of PDK1. This re-activated Akt in L-Pdk1KO mice liver
      and induced post-PH cell growth, without affecting cell proliferation.
      Further deletion of STAT3 (L-DKO mice) did not further deteriorate liver
      regeneration, although this certainly reduced post-PH mitotic response.
      These findings indicate that PDK1/Akt contribute to liver regeneration by
      regulating cell size. Regarding phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K),
      immediate upstream signal of PDK1, activation of PI3-K induced cell
      proliferation via STAT3 activation in the liver of L-Pdk1KO mice but did
      not improve impaired liver regeneration. This confirmed the pivotal role
      of PDK1 in liver regeneration and cell growth. Conclusion:
      PDK1/Akt-mediated responsive cell growth is essential for normal liver
      regeneration after PH, especially when cell proliferation is impaired.

TI  - New anti-cancer role for PDK1 inhibitors: preventing resistance to
      tamoxifen.
PG  - e5-7
AB  - Tamoxifen is one of the most prescribed anti-breast-cancer drugs, but
      tumours becoming resistant hinder its efficacy in the clinic. There is
      therefore great interest in developing strategies to reduce resistance and
      sensitize breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. A groundbreaking study by
      Iorns et al. published in this issue of the Biochemical Journal suggests
      that a signal transduction pathway controlled by PDK1
      (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) plays a crucial role in regulating
      the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. The implications of
      this study are that PDK1 or PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), Akt (also
      known as protein kinase B), S6K (S6 kinase) and mTOR (mammalian target of
      rapamycin) inhibitors, already being developed for cancer therapy, are
      likely to have additional utility in sensitizing breast tumours to
      tamoxifen. In this commentary we also discuss the possibility that
      inhibiting the PDK1 pathway may help overcome acquired resistance to other
      anti-cancer treatments.

TI  - Protein kinase C theta (PKCtheta)-dependent phosphorylation of PDK1 at
      Ser504 and Ser532 contributes to palmitate-induced insulin resistance.
PG  - 2038-44
AB  - Clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical studies have highlighted the
      role of obesity-induced insulin resistance in various metabolic diseases.
      However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be established. In
      the present study, we show that palmitate-induced serine phosphorylation
      of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) negatively regulates
      insulin signaling. PDK1-mediated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in the
      activation loop is reduced in C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate or
      overexpressing protein kinase C theta (PKCtheta), a kinase that has been
      implicated in hyperlipidemia-induced insulin resistance. Palmitate
      treatment also inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Akt
      phosphorylation, suggesting that the inhibition could occur at a site
      independent of IRS1/2. The inhibitory effect of palmitate on PDK1 and Akt
      was diminished in PKCtheta-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by
      treating C2C12 myotubes with PKCtheta pseudosubstrates. In vivo labeling
      studies revealed that PDK1 undergoes palmitate-induced phosphorylation at
      two novel sites, Ser504 and Ser532. Replacing Ser504/532 with alanine
      disrupted PKCtheta-catalyzed PDK1 phosphorylation in vitro and
      palmitate-induced PDK1 phosphorylation in cells. PDK1-deficient MEFs
      transiently expressing PDK1S504A/S532A but not PDK1S504E/S532D showed
      increased basal and insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 when
      compared with MEFs expressing wild-type PDK1. Taken together, our results
      identify PDK1 as a novel target in free fatty acid-induced insulin
      resistance and PKCtheta as the kinase mediating the negative regulation.

PG  - e19-21
AB  - The activation of the AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein
      kinase C)-family kinase SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1)
      by insulin via PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signalling has been
      appreciated for almost 10 years. PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase 1), a kinase that phosphorylates the SGK1 catalytic domain at
      Thr(256), is known to play a critical role in SGK1 activation. However,
      the identity of the protein kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of
      Ser(422), a site outside the catalytic domain (the so-called hydrophobic
      motif, or HM) that promotes activation of the kinase by PDK1, was unclear.
      In work reported in this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Garcia-Martinez
      and Alessi have revealed the identity of a 'PDK2' kinase that catalyses
      Ser(422) phosphorylation as mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex
      2), a multiprotein kinase that phosphorylates a similar site in PKB
      (protein kinase B).

TI  - OSU-03012, a novel celecoxib derivative, induces reactive oxygen
      species-related autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 9348-57
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the
      third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Systemic treatments for HCC
      have been largely unsuccessful. OSU-03012 is a derivative of celecoxib
      with anticancer activity. The mechanism of action is presumably
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) inhibition. This study
      investigated the potential of OSU-03012 as a treatment for HCC. OSU-03012
      inhibited cell growth of Huh7, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells with IC(50) below 1
      mumol/L. In Huh7 cells, OSU-03012 did not suppress PDK1 or AKT activity.
      Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
      assay and flow cytometry analysis indicated that OSU-03012 did not induce
      cellular apoptosis. Instead, morphologic studies by light and electron
      microscopy, as well as special biological staining with
      monodansylcadaverine, acridine orange, and microtubule-associated protein
      1 light chain 3, revealed OSU-03012-induced autophagy of Huh7 cells. This
      OSU-03012-induced autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine. Moreover,
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was detected after OSU-03012
      treatment. Blocking ROS accumulation with ROS scavengers inhibited
      autophagy formation, indicating that ROS accumulation and subsequent
      autophagy formation might be a major mechanism of action of OSU-03012.
      Daily oral treatment of BALB/c nude mice with OSU-03012 suppressed the
      growth of Huh7 tumor xenografts. Electron microscopic observation
      indicated that OSU-03012 induced autophagy in vivo. Together, our results
      show that OSU-03012 induces autophagic cell death but not apoptosis in HCC
      and that the autophagy-inducing activity is at least partially related to
      ROS accumulation.

TI  - p62 protects SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells against H2O2-induced injury
      through the PDK1/Akt pathway.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - The p62 protein has been identified as a major component of the protein
      aggregations associated with neurodegenerative disease. Oxidative insult
      has also been identified as a principal cause of neurodegenerative
      disease. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the potential role of
      p62 in oxidative stress-induced cell death in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma
      cells. The results indicated that H(2)O(2) treatment induced p62
      expression in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, p62 showed neuroprotective
      effects against H(2)O(2)-induced cell death in differentiated SH-SY5Y
      cells. p62 expression prolonged Akt phosphorylation during the later
      stages of H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. Furthermore, coexpression of p62
      and wild-type PDK1, the upstream kinase of Akt, further increased Akt
      phosphorylation and cell viability, whereas the expression of
      kinase-defective PDK1 reversed the cytoprotective effects of p62 under
      oxidative stress. Overexpression of p62 led to the dissociation of PDK1
      from the 14-3-3theta protein, which is thought to be a negative regulator
      of PDK1 kinase activity. These findings suggest a mechanism that involves
      the p62-mediated modulation of the interaction between signaling molecules
      and results in cell survival.

TI  - Glutamate acting on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors attenuates insulin-like
      growth factor-1 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and its survival
      signaling properties in rat hippocampal neurons.
PG  - 855-61
AB  - Impairing intracellular signaling induced by survival factors and excess
      glutamate have recently been suggested to play important role in
      neurodegenerative processes. However, the underlying mechanism(s) and
      interrelationships between these factors mostly remain to be established.
      In the present study, we show that glutamate attenuates the tyrosine
      phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor and
      the survival effect of IGF-1 (100 nm) in hippocampal cultured neurons.
      Pretreatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with glutamate concentration
      dependently inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors as
      well as that of IRS-1 and Shc, two IGF-1 receptor adapter proteins. The
      effect of glutamate was also evident on the phosphorylation of Akt, as
      well as its upstream kinase PI3K/PDK1 and downstream targets, GSK3beta and
      FOXO3a. The inhibitory effect of glutamate (1 mm) was blocked by
      antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, including MK801
      (20 microm) and AP5 (100 microm), but not by blockers of other ionotropic
      or metabotropic glutamate receptor sub-types demonstrating the involvement
      of the NMDA receptor. This hypothesis is supported further by the
      observation that treatment with NMDA concentration dependently inhibited
      the activation and phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors and downstream
      targets induced by IGF-1 (100 nm). These findings demonstrate that
      glutamate can block the effect of IGF-1 by decreasing IGF-1 receptor
      signaling and responsiveness, hence attenuating the survival properties of
      this trophic factor in neuronal cells. Our results also suggest a novel
      mechanism by which glutamate can reduce cell viability and induce
      neurotoxicity.

TI  - Small-molecule inhibitors of PDK1.
PG  - 1810-38
AB  - Signal transduction of many growth factors and oncogenes is mediated by
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), a master regulator
      of a number of downstream signal protein kinase cascades. Hence, PDK1
      represents a convergence point for receptor tyrosine kinase and
      cytokine-mediated pathways for the regulation of vital cell processes such
      as cell survival and proliferation. Pathological upregulation of PDK1
      signalling due to constitutive growth factor receptor activation and/or
      PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) mutations significantly triggers
      downstream signalling, e.g. PKB/Akt, which subsequently promote
      proliferative events such as tumour invasiveness, angiogenesis, and
      progression. Consistent with this, a mouse model expressing low levels of
      PDK1 is protected from tumourigenesis resulting from loss of PTEN. Because
      more than 50 % of all human cancers possess significant overstimulation of
      the PDK1 signalling pathway, inhibition of this protein kinase by small
      molecules is predicted to result in effective inhibition of cancer cell
      proliferation and thus be therapeutically beneficial. Various classes of
      small-molecule PDK1 inhibitors have been published in patents and papers.
      Herein we present for the first time a comprehensive collection of small
      molecules reported to interact with PDK1, and we refer to their biological
      characterisation in terms of activity and selectivity for PDK1.

TI  - Scaffolding function of PAK in the PDK1-Akt pathway.
PG  - 1356-64
AB  - Many extracellular signals stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, which
      in turn activates the Rac1 GTPase, the protein kinase Akt and the Akt Thr
      308 upstream kinase PDK1. Active Rac1 stimulates a number of events,
      including substrate phosphorylation by a subgroup of the PAK family of
      kinases. The combined effects of Rac1, PDK1 and Akt are crucial for cell
      migration, growth, survival, metabolism and tumorigenesis. Here we show
      that Rac1 stimulates a second, kinase-independent function of PAK1. The
      PAK1 kinase domain serves as a scaffold to facilitate Akt stimulation by
      PDK1 and to aid recruitment of Akt to the membrane. PAK differentially
      activates subpopulations of Akt. These findings reveal scaffolding
      functions of PAK that regulate the efficiency, localization and
      specificity of the PDK1-Akt pathway.

TI  - mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) controls hydrophobic motif phosphorylation and
      activation of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1).
PG  - 375-85
AB  - SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1) is a member of
      the AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C) family of
      protein kinases and is activated by agonists including growth factors.
      SGK1 regulates diverse effects of extracellular agonists by
      phosphorylating regulatory proteins that control cellular processes such
      as ion transport and growth. Like other AGC family kinases, activation of
      SGK1 is triggered by phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the
      T-loop of the kinase domain and a serine residue lying within the
      C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Ser(422) in SGK1). PDK1
      (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) phosphorylates the T-loop of SGK1.
      The identity of the hydrophobic motif kinase is unclear. Recent work has
      established that mTORC1 [mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) complex 1]
      phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2
      (mTOR complex 2) phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Akt (also known
      as protein kinase B). In the present study we demonstrate that SGK1
      hydrophobic motif phosphorylation and activity is ablated in knockout
      fibroblasts possessing mTORC1 activity, but lacking the mTORC2 subunits
      rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1
      (stress-activated-protein-kinase-interacting protein 1) or mLST8
      (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8). Furthermore, phosphorylation of
      NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated gene 1), a physiological substrate of
      SGK1, was also abolished in rictor-, Sin1- or mLST8-deficient fibroblasts.
      mTORC2 immunoprecipitated from wild-type, but not from mLST8- or
      rictor-knockout cells, phosphorylated SGK1 at Ser(422). Consistent with
      mTORC1 not regulating SGK1, immunoprecipitated mTORC1 failed to
      phosphorylate SGK1 at Ser(422), under conditions which it phosphorylated
      the hydrophobic motif of S6K. Moreover, rapamycin treatment of HEK (human
      embryonic kidney)-293, MCF-7 or HeLa cells suppressed phosphorylation of
      S6K, without affecting SGK1 phosphorylation or activation. The findings of
      the present study indicate that mTORC2, but not mTORC1, plays a vital role
      in controlling the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation and activity of SGK1.
      Our findings may explain why in previous studies phosphorylation of
      substrates, such as FOXO (forkhead box O), that could be regulated by SGK,
      are reduced in mTORC2-deficient cells. The results of the present study
      indicate that NDRG1 phosphorylation represents an excellent biomarker for
      mTORC2 activity.

TI  - The life of a cell: apoptosis regulation by the PI3K/PKB pathway.
PG  - 333-44
AB  - The activation of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) family members is a
      universal event in response to virtually all cytokines, growth factors and
      hormones. As a result of formation of PtdIns with an added phosphate at
      the 3 position of the inositol ring, activation of the protein kinases
      PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) and PKB (protein kinase B)/Akt
      occurs. The PI3K/PKB pathway impinges upon a remarkable array of
      intracellular events that influence either directly or indirectly whether
      or not a cell will undergo apoptosis. In this review, the many ways in
      which PI3K/PKB can control these processes are summarized. Not all of the
      events described will necessarily play a role in any one cell type, but a
      subset of these events is probably essential for the survival of every
      cell.

TI  - Potential inhibition of PDK1/Akt signaling by phenothiazines suppresses
      cancer cell proliferation and survival.
PG  - 393-403
AB  - 3'-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) has been identified for its
      ability to phosphorylate and activate Akt. Accumulated studies have shown
      that the activation of the PDK1/Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in cell
      survival, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Therefore, the PDK1/Akt
      pathway is believed to be a critical target for cancer intervention. In
      this paper, we report the discovery of a new function of phenothiazines,
      widely known as antipsychotics, inhibiting PDK1/Akt pathway. Upon
      epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, phenothiazines specifically
      suppressed the kinase activity of PDK1 and the phosphorylation level of
      Akt. The inhibition of PDK1/Akt kinase resulted in suppression of
      EGF-induced cell growth and induction of apoptosis in human ovary cancer
      cells. In particular, phenothiazines were highly selective for downstream
      targets of PDK1/Akt and did not inhibit the activation of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), EGFR, or extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). In particular, phenothiazines
      effectively suppressed tumor growth in nude mice of human cancer cells.
      Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence for novel function
      of phenothiazines, pharmacologically targeting PDK1/Akt for anticancer
      drug discovery.

      (PDK1) signalling pathways.
PG  - 2978-82
AB  - The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) mediates the
      cellular effect of insulin and growth factors by activating a group of
      kinases including PKB/Akt, S6K, RSK, SGK and PKC isoforms. PDK1 possesses
      two regulatory domains namely a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain that binds
      to the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)] second
      messenger, and a substrate binding site termed the PIF-pocket. Employing a
      combination of biochemical, structural and mouse knock-in approaches we
      have been able to define the roles that the regulatory domains on PDK1
      play. We have established that binding of PDK1 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) is
      essential for efficient activation of PKB isoforms as well as for
      maintaining normal cell size and insulin sensitivity. In contrast, the
      PIF-substrate binding pocket of PDK1 is not required for PKB activation,
      but is necessary for PDK1 to activate all of its other substrates.

PG  - 5511-26
AB  - The abnormal activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
      pathway has been validated by epidemiological and experimental studies as
      an essential step toward the initiation and maintenance of human tumors.
      Notable in this regard are the prevalent somatic genetic alterations
      leading to the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and
      gain-of-function mutations targeting PIK3CA--the gene encoding the
      catalytic phosphosinositide-3 kinase subunit p110 alpha. A number of the
      intracellular components of this pathway have been targeted as anticancer
      drug discovery activities leading to the current panoply of clinical
      trials of inhibitors of PI3K, Akt and HSP90 in man. This review summarizes
      current preclinical knowledge of modulators of the PI3K/Akt pathway in
      which drug discovery and development activities have been advanced
      focusing on both the relevant clinical stage inhibitors and other
      disclosed tool compounds targeting PI3K, PDK1, Akt and HSP90.

TI  - In vivo analysis of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt regulation in DNA-PKcs-null
      mice reveals a role for PKB/Akt in DNA damage response and tumorigenesis.
PG  - 30025-33
AB  - Full activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) requires phosphorylation on
      Thr-308 and Ser-473. It is well established that Thr-308 is phosphorylated
      by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Ser-473 phosphorylation
      is mediated by both mammalian target of rapamycin-rictor complex (mTORC2)
      and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) depending on type of stimulus.
      However, the physiological role of DNA-PK in the regulation of PKB
      phosphorylation remains to be established. To address this, we analyzed
      basal, insulin-induced, and DNA damage-induced PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation
      in DNA-PK catalytic subunit-null DNA-PKcs(-/-) mice. Our results revealed
      that DNA-PK is required for DNA damage-induced phosphorylation but
      dispensable for insulin- and growth factor-induced PKB Ser-473
      phosphorylation. Moreover, DNA-PKcs(-/-) mice showed a tissue-specific
      increase in basal PKB phosphorylation. In particular, persistent PKB
      hyperactivity in the thymus apparently contributed to spontaneous
      lymphomagenesis in DNA-PKcs(-/-) mice. Significantly, these tumors could
      be prevented by deletion of PKBalpha. These findings reveal
      stimulus-specific regulation of PKB activation by specific upstream
      kinases and provide genetic evidence of PKB deregulation in DNA-PKcs(-/-)
      mice.

TI  - Serine 396 of PDK1 is required for maximal PKB activation.
PG  - 2038-49
AB  - Protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt) is important for mediating
      survival and proliferation signals. Following activation, PKB shuttles to
      various compartments of the cell, including the nucleus, where it
      phosphorylates an array of targets. PKB is phosphorylated at T308 by its
      activator PDK1. PDK1 is normally excluded from the nucleus via a nuclear
      exclusion sequence (NES), and our previous work suggested that nuclear
      exclusion can be attenuated by IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of S396
      proximal to the NES. No studies have been done to test the significance of
      S396 phosphorylation or the impact of nuclear accumulation of PDK1 on PKB
      activation. To address these questions, we created isogenic embryonic stem
      cell (ESC) lines expressing various alleles of PDK1 within a PDK1-/-
      background. Disruption of the NES domain of PDK1 correlated with elevated
      PKB phosphorylation at both T308 and S473. In contrast, mutation of S396
      to alanine reduced PDK1 nuclear localization and reduced PKB
      phosphorylation and activation. The loss of phosphorylation of PKB by
      S396A mutation was rescued by forcing nuclear PDK1 or by conversion of
      S396 to an aspartic acid. The phosphorylation of the PKB substrate
      FOXO3alpha was reduced in S396A PDK1 ESC. Other known and suspected PKB
      substrates, including GSK3 and Raf1, were unaffected. This study therefore
      reveals that S396 plays a role in the activation of PKB leading to the
      regulated phosphorylation of some PKB substrates including FOXO3alpha.

TI  - Freud-1/Aki1, a novel PDK1-interacting protein, functions as a scaffold to
      activate the PDK1/Akt pathway in epidermal growth factor signaling.
PG  - 5996-6009
AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt pathway regulates various cellular functions,
      especially cell survival and cell cycle progression. In contrast to other
      survival pathways, there have been few reports of scaffold proteins that
      regulate signaling cascade specificity in this pathway. Here we identify a
      5' repressor element under dual-repression binding protein 1 (Freud-1)/Akt
      kinase-interacting protein 1 (Aki1) as a novel scaffold for the PDK1/Akt
      pathway. Freud-1/Aki1 (also known as CC2D1A) expression induced formation
      of a PDK1/Akt complex and regulated Akt activation in a
      concentration-dependent biphasic manner. Freud-1/Aki1 also associated with
      epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in response to EGF stimulation and
      was required for Akt activation induced by EGF, but not by insulin-like
      growth factor 1. Freud-1/Aki1 gene silencing decreased Akt kinase
      activity, resulting in induction of apoptosis and increased sensitivity
      toward chemotherapeutic agents. Our results suggest that Freud-1/Aki1 is a
      novel receptor-selective scaffold protein for the PDK1/Akt pathway and
      present a new activation mechanism of Akt.

TI  - TUSC4/NPRL2, a novel PDK1-interacting protein, inhibits PDK1 tyrosine
      phosphorylation and its downstream signaling.
PG  - 1827-34
AB  - 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key regulator of
      cell proliferation and survival signal transduction. PDK1 is known to be
      constitutively active and is further activated by Src-mediated
      phosphorylation at the tyrosine-9, -373, and -376 residues. To identify
      novel regulators of PDK1, we performed E. coli-based two-hybrid screening
      and revealed that tumor suppressor candidate 4 (TUSC4), also known as
      nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2), formed a complex with PDK1 and
      suppressed Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PDK1
      in vitro and in cells. The NH(2)-terminal 133 amino acid residues of TUSC4
      were involved in binding to PDK1. The deletion mutant of TUSC4 that lacked
      the NH(2)-terminal domain showed no inhibitory effects on PDK1 tyrosine
      phosphorylation or activation. Thus, complex formation is indispensable
      for TUSC4-mediated PDK1 inactivation. The siRNA-mediated down-regulation
      of TUSC4 induced cell proliferation, while ectopic TUSC4 expression
      inactivated the PDK1 downstream signaling pathway, including Akt and p70
      ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and increased cancer cell sensitivity to
      several anticancer drugs. Our results suggest that TUSC4/NPRL2, a novel
      PDK1-interacting protein, plays a role in regulating the Src/PDK1
      signaling pathway and cell sensitivity to multiple cancer chemotherapeutic
      drugs.

TI  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta expression and
      activation in lung cancer.
PG  - 689-96
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta) is
      a ligand-binding inducible transcriptional factor linked to
      carcinogenesis. Important functions of PPARbeta/delta were demonstrated in
      series of human epithelial cancers; however, its role in lung cancer
      remains controversial. We investigated the differential expression level
      and localization of PPARbeta/delta in tumors and adjacent normal lung
      tissue, and the effect of PPARbeta/delta activation on lung cancer cell
      proliferation and apoptosis. PPARbeta/delta was expressed in all studied
      human non-small cell lung cancers, and strong PPARbeta/delta
      immunoreactivity was observed in epithelial cells of more than 75% of
      studied lung tumors. PPARbeta/delta expression was consistently limited to
      the cancer cells in tumor tissue, while in adjacent normal lung tissue it
      was limited predominantly to the mononuclear cells. We found that
      ligand-binding activation of PPARbeta/delta stimulates cell proliferation
      (an effect that was blocked by a dominant-negative construct of
      PPARbeta/delta), stimulates anchorage-independent cell growth, and
      inhibits apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. Importantly, the activation
      of PPARbeta/delta induces Akt phosphorylation correlated with
      up-regulation of PDK1, down-regulation of PTEN, and increased expression
      of Bcl-xL and COX-2. These findings indicate that PPARbeta/delta exerts
      proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects via PI3K/Akt1 and COX-2 pathways.
      In conclusion, PPARbeta/delta is strongly expressed in the majority of
      lung cancers, and its activation induces proliferative and survival
      response in non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - A novel Epac-Rap-PP2A signaling module controls cAMP-dependent Akt
      regulation.
PG  - 23129-38
AB  - Rap1b has been implicated in the transduction of the cAMP mitogenic
      signal. It is phosphorylated and activated by cAMP, and its expression in
      models where cAMP is mitogenic leads to proliferation and tumorigenesis.
      Akt is a likely downstream effector of cAMP-Rap1 action. cAMP elevation
      induced a rapid and transient Akt inhibition that required activated and
      phosphorylated Rap1b. However, the mechanism(s) by which cAMP-Rap
      regulates Akt remains unclear. Here we show that (i) upstream regulators,
      PIK and PDK1, are not the target(s) of the cAMP inhibitory action; (ii)
      constitutively active Akt and calyculin A-stimulated Akt are resistant to
      cAMP inhibition, suggesting the action of a phosphatase; (iii) cAMP
      increases the rate of Akt dephosphorylation, directly implicating an
      Akt-phosphatase; (iv) Epac- and protein kinase A (PKA)-specific analogs
      synergistically inhibit Akt, indicating the involvement of both
      cAMP-dependent effector pathways; (v) H89 and dominant negative Epac 279E
      block cAMP-inhibitory action; (vi) Epac associates in a complex with Akt
      and PP2A, and the associated-phosphatase activity is positively modulated
      by cAMP in a PKA- and Rap1-dependent manner; (vii) like its action on Akt
      inhibition, PKA- and Epac-specific analogs synergistically activate
      Epac-associated PP2A; and (viii) dominant negative PP2A blocks
      cAMP-inhibitory action. Thus, we uncovered a novel
      cAMP-Epac/PKA-Rap1b-PP2A signaling module involved in Akt regulation that
      may represent a physiological event in the process of cAMP stimulation of
      thyroid mitogenesis.

TI  - Hinokitiol, a natural tropolone derivative, inhibits TNF-alpha production
      in LPS-activated macrophages via suppression of NF-kappaB.
PG  - 828-33
AB  - In this study, we examined the modulatory effect of hinokitiol (HK) on the
      production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a critical factor
      involved in skin inflammation and hair follicle apoptosis. HK effectively
      suppressed TNF-alpha production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated,
      macrophage-like (RAW264.7) cells. This compound also diminished mRNA
      synthesis of TNF-alpha, indicating that HK-mediated inhibition may occur
      at the transcriptional level. Moreover, this compound down-regulated the
      phosphorylation of PDK1, Akt/PKB, and ERK, resulting in a loss of nuclear
      factor (NF)-kappaB activation, which is detectable by immunoblotting and
      reporter gene assays. Therefore, these results suggest that HK may cure
      hair loss by suppressing factors that promote follicular apoptosis, such
      as TNF-alpha, in addition to stimulating new hair growth.

TI  - Highly prevalent genetic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases and
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase
      pathways in anaplastic and follicular thyroid cancers.
PG  - 3106-16
AB  - CONTEXT: Genetic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK pathways have not been
      fully defined in anaplastic and follicular thyroid cancers [anaplastic
      thyroid cancer (ATC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)]. OBJECTIVE: The
      objective of the study was to explore a wide-range genetic basis for the
      involvement of these pathways in ATC. DESIGN: We examined mutations and
      copy number gains of a large panel of genes in these pathways and
      corresponding phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK) and Akt. RESULTS: We found
      frequent copy gains of RTK genes, including EGFR, PDGFRalpha and -beta,
      VEGFR1 and 2, KIT, and MET and in PIK3Ca, PIK3Cb, and PDK1 genes in the
      PI3K/Akt pathway. Mutations of Ras, PIK3Ca, PTEN, and BRAF genes and
      RET/PTC rearrangements were common, whereas mutations in PDK1, Akt1, Akt2,
      and RTK genes were uncommon in ATC. Overall, 46 of 48 ATC (95.8%) harbored
      at least one genetic alteration, and coexistence of two or more was seen
      in 37 of 48 ATC (77.1%). These genetic alterations were somewhat less
      common in FTC. Genetic alterations that could activate both the PI3K/Akt
      and MAPK pathways were found in 39 of 48 ATC (81.3%). RTK gene copy gains
      were preferentially associated with p-Akt, suggesting their dominant role
      in activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. The phosphorylation of Akt was far
      more common than p-ERK in FTC, and both were relatively common and often
      coexisted in ATC. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations in the RTKs and
      PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways are extremely prevalent in ATC and FTC,
      providing a strong genetic basis for an extensive role of these signaling
      pathways and the development of therapies targeting these pathways for ATC
      and FTC, particularly the former.

TI  - Morusin induces apoptosis and suppresses NF-kappaB activity in human
      colorectal cancer HT-29 cells.
PG  - 236-42
AB  - Morusin is a pure compound isolated from root bark of Morusaustralis
      (Moraceae). In this study, we demonstrated that morusin significantly
      inhibited the growth and clonogenicity of human colorectal cancer HT-29
      cells. Apoptosis induced by morusin was characterized by accumulation of
      cells at the sub-G(1) phase, fragmentation of DNA, and condensation of
      chromatin. Morusin also inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK-alpha,
      IKK-beta and IkappaB-alpha, increased expression of IkappaB-alpha, and
      suppressed nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and its DNA binding
      activity. Dephosphorylation of NF-kappaB upstream regulators PI3K, Akt and
      PDK1 was also displayed. In addition, activation of caspase-8, change of
      mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO,
      and activation of caspase-9 and -3 were observed at the early time point.
      Downregulation in the expression of Ku70 and XIAP was exhibited afterward.
      Caspase-8 or wide-ranging caspase inhibitor suppressed morusin-induced
      apoptosis. Therefore, the antitumor mechanism of morusin in HT-29 cells
      may be via activation of caspases and inhibition of NF-kappaB.

TI  - PKBalpha/Akt1 acts downstream of DNA-PK in the DNA double-strand break
      response and promotes survival.
PG  - 203-13
AB  - Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is a well-established regulator of several
      essential cellular processes. Here, we report a route by which activated
      PKB promotes survival in response to DNA insults in vivo. PKB activation
      following DNA damage requires 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)
      and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Active PKB localizes in the
      nucleus of gamma-irradiated cells adjacent to DNA double-strand breaks,
      where it colocalizes and interacts with DNA-PK. Levels of active PKB
      inversely correlate with DNA damage-induced apoptosis. A significant
      portion of p53- and DNA damage-regulated genes are misregulated in cells
      lacking PKBalpha. PKBalpha knockout mice show impaired DNA
      damage-dependent induction of p21 and increased tissue apoptosis after
      single-dose whole-body irradiation. Our findings place PKB downstream of
      DNA-PK in the DNA damage response signaling cascade, where it provides a
      prosurvival signal, in particular by affecting transcriptional p21
      regulation. Furthermore, this function is apparently restricted to the
      PKBalpha isoform.

TI  - PDK1 regulates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through
      control of cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 expression.
PG  - 17702-11
AB  - PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) is a key mediator of
      signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase. To gain insight into the
      physiological importance of PDK1 in cell proliferation and cell cycle
      control, we established immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
      from mice homozygous for a "floxed" allele of Pdk1 and from wild-type
      mice. Introduction of Cre recombinase by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer
      resulted in the depletion of PDK1 in Pdk1(lox/lox) MEFs but not in
      Pdk1(+/+) MEFs. The insulin-like growth factor-1-induced phosphorylation
      of various downstream effectors of PDK1, including Akt, glycogen synthase
      kinase 3, ribosomal protein S6, and p70 S6 kinase, was markedly inhibited
      in the PDK1-depleted (Pdk1-KO) MEFs. The rate of serum-induced cell
      proliferation was reduced; progression of the cell cycle from the
      G(0)-G(1) phase to the S phase was delayed, and cell cycle progression at
      G(2)-M phase was impaired in Pdk1-KO MEFs. These cells also manifested an
      increased level of p27(Kip1) expression and a reduced level of cyclin D1
      expression during cell cycle progression. The defect in cell cycle
      progression from the G(0)-G(1) to the S phase in Pdk1-KO MEFs was rescued
      by forced expression of cyclin D1, whereas rescue of the defect in G(2)-M
      progression in these cells required both overexpression of cyclin D1 and
      depletion of p27(Kip1) by RNA interference. These data indicate that PDK1
      plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression
      by controlling the expression of both cyclin D1 and p27(Kip1).

TI  - A Rictor-Myo1c complex participates in dynamic cortical actin events in
      3T3-L1 adipocytes.
PG  - 4215-26
AB  - Insulin signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)
      activates the protein kinase Akt through phosphorylation of its threonine
      308 and serine 473 residues by the PDK1 protein kinase and the
      Rictor-mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC2), respectively.
      Remarkably, we show here that the Rictor protein is also present in
      cultured adipocytes in complexes containing Myo1c, a molecular motor that
      promotes cortical actin remodeling. Interestingly, the Rictor-Myo1c
      complex is biochemically distinct from the previously reported mTORC2 and
      can be immunoprecipitated independently of mTORC2. Furthermore, while RNA
      interference-directed silencing of Rictor results in the expected
      attenuation of Akt phosphorylation at serine 473, depletion of Myo1c is
      without effect. In contrast, loss of either Rictor or Myo1c inhibits
      phosphorylation of the actin filament regulatory protein paxillin at
      tyrosine 118. Furthermore, Myo1c-induced membrane ruffling of 3T3-L1
      adipocytes is also compromised following Rictor knockdown. Interestingly,
      neither the mTORC2 inhibitor rapamycin nor the PI 3-kinase inhibitor
      wortmannin affects paxillin tyrosine 118 phosphorylation. Taken together,
      our findings suggest that the Rictor-Myo1c complex is distinct from mTORC2
      and that Myo1c, in conjunction with Rictor, participates in cortical actin
      remodeling events.

TI  - Hepatic insulin resistance induced by prenatal alcohol exposure is
      associated with reduced PTEN and TRB3 acetylation in adult rat offspring.
PG  - R1797-806
AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (EtOH) results in insulin resistance in rats of
      both sexes with increased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes and
      glucose production. To investigate whether hepatic insulin signaling is
      defective, we studied 3-mo-old female offspring of dams that were given
      EtOH during pregnancy compared with those from pair-fed and control dams.
      We performed an intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test, determined the
      phosphorylation status of hepatic phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase-1 (PDK1), Akt, and PKCzeta before and after intravenous insulin
      bolus, and measured mRNA and in vivo acetylation of TRB3 (tribbles 3) and
      PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) as well as
      the expression of the histone acetylase (HAT) PCAF (p300/CREB-binding
      protein-associated factor), histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), and HAT and
      HDAC activities. In EtOH compared with pair-fed and control offspring,
      basal and pyruvate-induced blood glucose was increased, insulin-induced
      PDK1, Akt, and PKCzeta phosphorylation was reduced, and expression of PTEN
      and TRB3 was increased while their acetylation status was decreased in
      association with increased HDAC and decreased HAT activities. Thus female
      adult rats prenatally exposed to EtOH have increased gluconeogenesis,
      reduced insulin signaling, and increased PTEN and TRB3 expression in the
      liver. In addition, PTEN and TRB3 are hypoacetylated, which can contribute
      to Akt-inhibiting activity. These results suggest that hepatic insulin
      resistance in rats prenatally exposed to EtOH is explained, at least in
      part, by increased PTEN and TRB3 activity due to both increased gene
      expression and reduced acetylation.

TI  - Lkb1 deficiency causes prostate neoplasia in the mouse.
PG  - 2223-32
AB  - Mutation of LKB1 is the key molecular event underlying Peutz-Jeghers
      syndrome, a dominantly inherited condition characterized by a
      predisposition to a range of malignancies, including those of the
      reproductive system. We report here the use of a Cre-LoxP strategy to
      directly address the role of Lkb1 in prostate neoplasia. Recombination of
      a LoxP-flanked Lkb1 allele within all four murine prostate lobes was
      mediated by spontaneous activation of a p450 CYP1A1-driven Cre recombinase
      transgene (termed AhCre). Homozygous mutation of Lkb1 in males expressing
      AhCre reduced longevity, with 100% manifesting atypical hyperplasia and
      83% developing prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) of the anterior
      prostate within 2 to 4 months. We also observed focal hyperplasia of the
      dorsolateral and ventral lobes (61% and 56% incidence, respectively),
      bulbourethral gland cysts associated with atypical hyperplasia (100%
      incidence), hyperplasia of the urethra (39% incidence), and seminal
      vesicle squamous metaplasia (11% incidence). PIN foci overexpressed
      nuclear beta-catenin, p-Gsk3 beta, and downstream Wnt targets.
      Immunohistochemical analysis of foci also showed a reduction in Pten
      activation and up-regulation of both p-PDK1 (an AMPK kinase) and
      phosphorylated Akt. Our data are therefore consistent with deregulation of
      Wnt and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascades after loss of
      Lkb1 function. For the first time, this model establishes a link between
      the tumor suppressor Lkb1 and prostate neoplasia, highlighting a tumor
      suppressive role within the mouse and raising the possibility of a similar
      association in the human.

TI  - Inhibition of Akt pathway phosphorylation as a mechanism in the
      pathogenesis of functional intestinal obstruction in carcinomatosis
      peritonei.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to confirm our
      hypothesis that the development of functional intestinal obstruction in
      carcinomatosis peritonei (CP) is related to cytokine-mediated inhibition
      of the Akt pathway and to investigate the phenomenon of relative adrenal
      insufficiency in CP. METHODS: Human adrenocortical cells (NCI-H295R) were
      treated with serum derived from eight cancer patients who had intestinal
      obstruction and functional adrenal insufficiency. Serum from three normal
      healthy subjects and three who had CP but without intestinal obstruction
      or adrenal insufficiency were used as controls. The differential effects
      of serum on the treated cells were studied using Western blot analysis.
      Cortisol production of these treated cells was assayed with cortisol ELISA
      kits. RESULTS: Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Ser308 in cells was
      significantly reduced when treated with serum from patients with
      intestinal obstruction but not controls. Phosphorylation of PDK1 at
      Ser241, mTOR downstream targets like p70S6 at Thr421/Ser424 and Thr389,
      and lastly 4EBP-1 at Ser70 a downstream target of p70S6 was reduced by
      approximately 50%, 40%, and 70%, respectively. There was enhanced
      phosphorylation of elF4E an initiating factor in protein translation in
      cells treated with patient serum compared to controls. Cortisol synthesis
      was stimulated upon treatment with patient serum but not with control
      serum. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation is a mechanism that
      could play a major role in the development of intestinal obstruction in
      carcinomatosis peritonei. The identification of the mediating cytokines
      will lead to the development of cogent targeted therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Steroid hormone release as well as renal water and electrolyte excretion
      of mice expressing PKB/SGK-resistant GSK3.
PG  - 1207-16
AB  - Insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) participate in the
      regulation of renal electrolyte excretion. Insulin- and IGF1-dependent
      signaling includes phosphatidylinositide-3 (PI3)-kinase,
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 as well as protein kinase B (PKB)
      and serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase (SGK) isoforms, which in
      turn phosphorylate and thus inhibit glycogen synthase kinase
      GSK3alpha,beta. Replacement of the serines in the PKB/SGK consensus
      sequences by alanine (gsk3 ( KI )) confers resistance of GSK3 to PKB/SGK.
      To explore the role of PKB/SGK-dependent inhibition of GSK3 in the
      regulation of water/electrolyte metabolism, mice carrying the PKB/SGK
      resistant mutant (gsk3 ( KI )) were compared to their wild-type
      littermates (gsk3 ( WT ) ). Body weight was similar in gsk3 ( KI ) and
      gsk3 ( WT ) mice. Plasma aldosterone at 10 A.M: . and corticosterone
      concentrations at 5 P.M: . were significantly lower, but 24-h urinary
      aldosterone was significantly higher, and corticosterone excretion tended
      to be higher in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice. Food and water
      intake, fecal excretion, glomerular filtration rate, urinary flow rate,
      urine osmolarity, as well as urinary Na+, K+, urea excretion were
      significantly larger, and plasma Na+, urea, but not K+ concentration, were
      significantly lower in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice. Body
      temperature was significantly higher in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT )
      mice. When allowed to choose between tap water and saline, gsk3 ( WT )
      mice drank more saline, whereas gsk3 ( KI ) mice drank similar large
      volumes of tap water and saline. During high-salt diet, urinary
      vasopressin excretion increased to significantly higher levels in gsk3 (
      KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice. After water deprivation, body weight
      decreased faster in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice. Blood pressure,
      however, was significantly higher in gsk3 ( KI ) than in gsk3 ( WT ) mice.
      The observations disclose a role of PKB/SGK-dependent GSK3 activity in the
      regulation of steroid hormone release, renal water and electrolyte
      excretion and blood pressure control.

TI  - Mutation of the PDK1 PH domain inhibits protein kinase B/Akt, leading to
      small size and insulin resistance.
PG  - 3258-72
AB  - PDK1 activates a group of kinases, including protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt,
      p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), and serum and glucocorticoid-induced
      protein kinase (SGK), that mediate many of the effects of insulin as well
      as other agonists. PDK1 interacts with phosphoinositides through a
      pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. To study the role of this interaction, we
      generated knock-in mice expressing a mutant of PDK1 incapable of binding
      phosphoinositides. The knock-in mice are significantly small, insulin
      resistant, and hyperinsulinemic. Activation of PKB is markedly reduced in
      knock-in mice as a result of lower phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308, the
      residue phosphorylated by PDK1. This results in the inhibition of the
      downstream mTOR complex 1 and S6K1 signaling pathways. In contrast,
      activation of SGK1 or p90 ribosomal S6 kinase or stimulation of S6K1
      induced by feeding is unaffected by the PDK1 PH domain mutation. These
      observations establish the importance of the PDK1-phosphoinositide
      interaction in enabling PKB to be efficiently activated with an animal
      model. Our findings reveal how reduced activation of PKB isoforms impinges
      on downstream signaling pathways, causing diminution of size as well as
      insulin resistance.

TI  - Melatonin prevents the injury-induced decline of Akt/forkhead
      transcription factors phosphorylation.
PG  - 199-203
AB  - Melatonin plays a neuroprotective role against brain injury through the
      activation of Akt and the inhibition of apoptotic cell death. This study
      investigated whether melatonin modulates the anti-apoptotic signal through
      the activation of Akt and its downstream targets, FKHR, AFX, and 14-3-3.
      Adult male rats were treated with melatonin (5 mg/kg) prior to middle
      cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and brain tissues were collected at 24 hr
      after MCAO. This study confirmed that melatonin significantly reduces
      infarct volume and decreases the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the
      cerebral cortex. Potential activation was measured by phosphorylation of
      PDK1 at Ser(241), Akt at Ser(473), FKHR at Ser(256), and AFX at Ser(193)
      using Western blot analysis. Melatonin prevented the injury-induced
      reduction of pPDK1, pAkt, pFKHR, and pAFX. However, melatonin did not
      affect the level of 14-3-3, which acts as an anti-apoptotic factor through
      interaction of pFKHR. Further, in the presence of melatonin, the
      interaction of pFKHR and 14-3-3 increased, compared with that of control
      animals. This study suggests that melatonin plays a potent protective role
      against brain injury and that Akt activation and FKHR phosphorylation by
      melatonin mediated these protective effects.

TI  - RalGDS couples growth factor signaling to Akt activation.
PG  - 2851-9
AB  - The Akt kinase is a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. It
      is activated in part by PDK1-induced phosphorylation. Here we show that
      RalGDS, a Ras effector protein that activates Ral GTPases, has a second
      function that promotes Akt phosphorylation by PDK1 by bringing these two
      kinases together. In support of this conclusion is our finding that
      suppression of RalGDS expression in cells inhibits both epidermal growth
      factor and insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, while PDK1
      complexes with N-GDS, Akt complexes with the central region of RalGDS
      through an intermediary, JIP1. The biological significance of this newly
      discovered RalGDS function is highlighted by the observation that an
      N-terminally deleted mutant of RalGDS that retains the ability to activate

      factor signaling to both Ral GTPase and Akt-mediated signaling cascades.

TI  - Isoform-specific defects of insulin stimulation of Akt/protein kinase B
      (PKB) in skeletal muscle cells from type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 512-21
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is
      required for the metabolic actions of insulin. Controversial data have
      been reported regarding Akt defective activation in the muscle of type 2
      diabetic patients. Because three Akt isoforms exist, each having a
      distinct physiological role, we investigated the contribution of
      isoform-specific defects to insulin signalling in human muscle. METHODS:
      The phosphorylation pattern and kinase activity of each Akt isoform were
      compared in primary myotubes from healthy control participants and type 2
      diabetic patients. Phosphorylation of Ser(473) and of Thr(308) in each
      isoform was determined after immunoprecipitation in myotubes treated or
      not with insulin. RESULTS: Muscle cells from diabetic patients displayed
      defective insulin action and a drastic reduction of insulin-stimulated
      activity of all Akt isoforms. This was associated with specific defects of
      their phosphorylation pattern in response to insulin, with impaired Akt2-
      (and to a lower extent Akt3-) Ser(473) phosphorylation, and with altered
      Akt1-Thr(308) phosphorylation. These defects were not due to faulty
      phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) production or
      activation. Rather, we found higher levels of the Akt2-Ser(473)-specific
      protein phosphatase PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1
      (PHLPP1) in muscle from diabetic patients, which may contribute to the
      alteration of Akt2-Ser(473) phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:
      These results suggest that several mechanisms affecting Akt isoforms,
      including deregulated production of PHLPP1, could underlie the alterations
      of skeletal muscle insulin signalling in type 2 diabetes. Taking into
      account the recently described isoform-specific metabolic functions of
      Akt, our results provide mechanistic insight that may contribute to the
      defective regulation of glucose and lipid metabolisms in the muscle of
      diabetic patients.

TI  - Regulation of Akt/PKB activity by P21-activated kinase in cardiomyocytes.
PG  - 429-34
AB  - Akt/PKB is a critical regulator of cardiac function and morphology, and
      its activity is governed by dual phosphorylation at active loop (Thr308)
      by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and at
      carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic motif (Ser473) by a putative PDK2.
      P21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase
      implicated in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and contractility and
      was shown previously to activate Akt through an undefined mechanism. Here
      we report Pak1 as a potential PDK2 that is essential for Akt activity in
      cardiomyocytes. Both Pak1 and Akt can be activated by multiple
      hypertrophic stimuli or growth factors in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
      (PI3K)-dependent manner. Pak1 overexpression induces Akt phosphorylation
      at both Ser473 and Thr308 in cardiomyocytes. Conversely, silencing or
      inactivating Pak1 gene diminishes Akt phosphorylation in vitro and in
      vivo. Purified Pak1 can directly phosphorylate Akt only at Ser473,
      suggesting that Pak1 may be a relevant PDK2 responsible for AKT Ser473
      phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. In addition, Pak1 protects
      cardiomyocytes from cell death, which is blocked by Akt inhibition. Our
      results connect two important regulators of cellular physiological
      functions and provide a potential mechanism for Pak1 signaling in
      cardiomyocytes.

TI  - Overexpression of Par-4 enhances thapsigargin-induced apoptosis via
      down-regulation of XIAP and inactivation of Akt in human renal cancer
      cells.
PG  - 358-68
AB  - The prostate-apoptosis-response-gene-4 (Par-4) protein has been shown to
      function as an effector of cell death in response to various apoptotic
      stimuli that trigger mitochondria and membrane receptor-mediated cell
      death pathways. We found that overexpressing Par-4 by stable transfection
      sensitizes Caki cells to induction of apoptosis by TRAIL and drugs that
      induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin
      (TU) and etoposide]. Ectopic expression of Par-4 is associated with
      decreased levels of XIAP protein in TG-treated cells, caused in part by
      XIAP protein instability and caspase activation. Levels of phospho-Akt are
      decreased in Caki/Par-4 cells to a significantly greater extent than in
      Caki/Vector cells by treatment with TG, and this is in turn associated
      with decreased levels of phospho-PDK1, the kinase upstream of Akt. In
      conclusion, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of Par-4
      sensitizes Caki cells to TG and that XIAP protein instability and
      inactivation of Akt are important in cellular pathways affected by Par-4.

TI  - Regulation of B-cell development by BCAP and CD19 through their binding to
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
PG  - 1497-503
AB  - Despite the importance of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in B-cell
      development, its activation mechanism still remains elusive. In this
      study, we show that deletion of both BCAP and CD19 leads to an almost
      complete block of BCR-mediated Akt activation and to severe defects in
      generation of immature and mature B cells. The YXXM motifs in BCAP and
      CD19 are crucial for regulating B-cell development in that mutation of
      these motifs abrogated their ability to induce BCR-mediated Akt activation
      as well as to promote B-cell development. Furthermore, the developmental
      defect in CD19(-/-)BCAP(-/-) B cells was partly relieved by introducing a
      constitutively active form of PI3K or PDK1. Together, our data suggest
      that BCAP and CD19 have complementary roles in BCR-mediated PI3K
      activation, thereby, at least in part, contributing to B-cell development.

TI  - Regulation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) by Src
      involves tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 and Src homology 2 domain
      binding.
PG  - 1480-91
AB  - 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) appears to play a
      central regulatory role in many cell signalings between phosphoinositide-3
      kinase and various intracellular serine/threonine kinases. In resting
      cells, PDK1 is known to be constitutively active and is further activated
      by tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr(9) and Tyr(373/376)) following the
      treatment of the cell with insulin or pervanadate. However, little is
      known about the mechanisms for this additional activation of PDK1. Here,
      we report that the SH2 domain of Src, Crk, and GAP recognized
      tyrosine-phosphorylated PDK1 in vitro. Destabilization of PDK1 induced by
      geldanamycin (a Hsp90 inhibitor) was partially blocked in HEK 293 cells
      expressing PDK1-Y9F. Co-expression of Hsp90 enhanced PDK1-Src complex
      formation and led to further increased PDK1 activity toward PKB and SGK.
      Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-phospho-Tyr(9) antibodies showed
      that the level of Tyr(9) phosphorylation was markedly increased in tumor
      samples compared with normal. Taken together, these data suggest that
      phosphorylation of PDK1 on Tyr(9), distinct from Tyr(373/376), is
      important for PDK1/Src complex formation, leading to PDK1 activation.
      Furthermore, Tyr(9) phosphorylation is critical for the stabilization of
      both PDK1 and the PDK1/Src complex via Hsp90-mediated protection of PDK1
      degradation.

TI  - Leflunomide inhibits PDK1/Akt pathway and induces apoptosis of human mast
      cells.
PG  - 6479-84
AB  - Mast cells release many inflammatory mediators that play an important role
      not only in allergic diseases but also in chronic inflammatory diseases,
      autoimmune diseases, and others. A lot of mast cells exist in synovium of
      rheumatoid arthritis, and it is known that synovitis does not occur in
      mast cell-deficient mice. Thus, it is thought that mast cells play a very
      important role in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. Leflunomide is a drug
      used clinically in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We used clinical
      doses of 2-cyano-3-hydroxy-N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-butenamide (A77
      1726), which is an active metabolite of leflunomide, and decreased the
      number of viable human primary mast cells in a concentration-dependent
      manner. This decrease was not reversed by uridine. Inhibition of
      pyrimidine synthesis by dihydro-orotic acid dehydrogenase inhibition,
      which is the primary mechanism of action of A77 1726, was not involved.
      A77 1726 dramatically induced apoptosis of human mast cells and inhibited
      the phosphorylation of Akt, an important survival signal of mast cells, in
      a concentration-dependent manner. Caspases 3 and 9, downstream molecules
      of Akt survival pathway, were also fragmented by A77 1726. In addition, it
      became evident for the first time that the mechanism involved in this
      result was the concentration-dependent inhibition of PDK1 phosphorylation,
      which controls the activation of Akt. These results indicate a new way of
      controlling mast cells and may therefore be the basis for innovative
      approaches to the treatment of various diseases related to mast cells.

TI  - Effects of wortmannin on phosphorylation of PDK1, GSK3-beta, PTEN and
      expression of Skp2 mRNA after ischemia/reperfusion injury in the mouse
      kidney.
PG  - 185-92
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), glycogen synthase
      kinase-3beta (GSK3-beta) and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on
      chromosome 10 (PTEN), which are the components of the phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and expression of S-phase kinase-associated
      protein 2 (Skp2) messenger RNA (mRNA) in renal ischemia/reperfusion.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three experimental groups, sham-operative mice,
      vehicle-delivered mice and wortmannin-treated ischemia/reperfusion injury
      (IRI) mice were designed to examine PDK1, GSK3-beta and PTEN
      phosphorylation status, as well as expression of Skp2 mRNA at 30 min, 90
      min, 24 h and 48 h of reperfusion after ischemia treatment. Wortmannin or
      its vehicle was given intraperitoneally 4 h before surgery. Expression of
      Skp2 mRNA was examined by semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and
      the components of the PI3K/Akt pathway were detected by western blotting
      in the IRI kidney. RESULTS: Phosphorylation of PDK1(Ser241),
      GSK3-beta(Ser9) and PTEN(Ser380) was increased after ischemia/reperfusion
      in the mouse kidney, and phosphorylation of PDK1 was reduced by wortmannin
      administration. The renal Skp2 mRNA increased after IRI in mouse, which
      could be inhibited by wortmannin. CONCLUSIONS: Our primary study suggests
      that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating
      the repair following renal IRI. The Skp2 mRNA increased in the IRI kidney
      and may be regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway.

TI  - Abelson interactor protein-1 positively regulates breast cancer cell
      proliferation, migration, and invasion.
PG  - 1031-9
AB  - Abelson interactor protein-1 (ABI-1) is an adaptor protein involved in
      actin reorganization and lamellipodia formation. It forms a macromolecular
      complex containing Hspc300/WASP family verprolin-homologous proteins
      2/ABI-1/nucleosome assembly protein 1/PIR121 or Abl/ABI-1/WASP family
      verprolin-homologous proteins 2 in response to Rho family-dependent
      stimuli. Due to its role in cell mobility, we hypothesized that ABI-1 has
      a role in invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we found that
      weakly invasive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3,
      and CAMA1) express lower levels of ABI-1 compared with highly invasive
      breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, BT549, and Hs578T),
      which exhibit high ABI-1 levels. Using RNA interference, ABI-1 was stably
      down-regulated in MDA-MB-231, which resulted in decreased cell
      proliferation and anchorage-dependent colony formation and abrogation of
      lamellipodia formation on fibronectin. Down-regulation of ABI-1 decreased
      invasiveness and migration ability and decreased adhesion on collagen IV
      and actin polymerization in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, compared with
      control parental cells, ABI-1 small interfering RNA-transfected cells
      showed decreased levels of phospho-PDK1, phospho-Raf, phospho-AKT, total
      AKT, and AKT1. These data suggest that ABI-1 plays an important role in
      the spread of breast cancer and that this role may be mediated via the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.

TI  - FOXO transcription factor-dependent p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) expression.
PG  - 1677-86
AB  - FOXO (Forkhead box O) transcription factors are involved in cell-cycle
      arrest or apoptosis induction by transcripting cell-cycle inhibitor
      p27(KIP1) or apoptosis-related genes, respectively. Akt/protein kinase B
      promotes cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis, in part, by
      phosphorylating FOXOs. Phosphorylated FOXOs could not exhibit
      transcriptional activity because of their nuclear export. Here we show
      that p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) transcription is associated with
      FOXO-mediated G1 cell-cycle arrest. Inhibition of Akt signaling by PI3K
      inhibitors, a PDK1 inhibitor, or dominant-negative Akt transfection
      increased expression of p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) but not p16(INK4a) and
      p18(INK4c). Ectopic expression of wild type or active FOXO but not
      inactive form also increased p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) levels. FOXOs bound
      to promoter regions and induced transcription of these genes. No increase
      in the G1-arrested cell population, mediated by PI3K inhibitor LY294002,
      was observed in INK4b-/- or INK4d-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts. In
      summary, FOXOs are involved in G1 arrest caused by Akt inactivation via
      p15(INK4b) and p19(INK4d) transcription.

TI  - Haloperidol induces the nuclear translocation of phosphatidylinositol
      3'-kinase to disrupt Akt phosphorylation in PC12 cells.
PG  - 323-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antipsychotic drug haloperidol (HAL) has been linked to
      apoptosis and to inhibition of prosurvival Akt signalling in
      pheochromocytoma (PC12) and neuronal cell cultures. However, the mechanism
      involved is unclear. METHODS: We used HAL to induce cytotoxicity in
      preneuronal PC12 cells. The expression and the subcellular localization of
      selected components of the PI3K-Akt survival cascade were monitored with
      standard biochemical approaches, such as subcellular fractionation,
      western blot analysis, gene transfer and fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS:
      PC12 cell stimulation with the epidermal growth factor (used as a control)
      results in normal processing of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt
      signalling (e.g., localization of PI3K to the plasma membrane and
      phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473). Surprisingly, HAL induces PI3K-generated
      phosphoinositol [phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which
      conflicts with its ability to inhibit Akt. In fact, the production of
      PIP3s is nuclear, as assessed by the localized concentration of a
      fluorophore-tagged PIP3-targeting pleckstrin homology protein and a
      fluorophore-tagged substrate-trapping mutant of the phosphoinositide
      phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10
      (PTEN). However, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1, the
      activating kinase of Akt) does not colocalize to the nucleus with the PI3K
      complex. This effectively inactivates both cytoplasmic and nuclear pools
      of Akt. CONCLUSION: The differential compartmentalization of effectors of
      the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway is a unique means by which HAL disrupts Akt
      functioning in PC12 cells.

TI  - Investigate the role of PTEN in chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells.
PG  - 2227-36
AB  - Chemotaxis plays an important role in metastasis of cancer cells. In the
      current study, we investigated the role of PTEN, a tumor suppressor, in
      chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells. Over-expression of PTEN inhibited
      EGF-induced chemotaxis, probably due to an overall reduction of PIP(3)
      levels. Disruption of PTEN by siRNA caused a marked decrease in
      chemokinesis, cell adhesion, and membrane spreading, resulting in a severe
      defect in chemotaxis. In PTEN disrupted cells, PDK1, AKT, and PKCzeta
      exhibited elevated basal activities, which prevented EGF-induced further
      activation of these molecules. In the absence of EGF, active PDK1 was
      detected on multiple directions of the plasma membranes of PTEN disrupted
      cells, which competed against EGF-induced gradient sensing. To confirm the
      biological relevance of in vitro studies, both PTEN disrupted cells and
      its parental human breast cancer cells were injected into tail veins of
      SCID mice. Mice injected with PTEN disrupted cancer cells showed a marked
      decrease in lung metastasis. Taken together, our data show that PTEN plays
      a non-redundant role in EGF-induced chemotaxis of human breast cancer
      cells, and an optimal level of PTEN is required in these responses.

TI  - Akt mediates the effect of insulin on epithelial sodium channels by
      inhibiting Nedd4-2.
PG  - 29866-73
AB  - The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) plays an important role in
      transepithelial Na(+) absorption; hence its function is essential for
      maintaining Na(+) and fluid homeostasis and regulating blood pressure.
      Insulin is one of the hormones that regulates activity of ENaC. In this
      study, we investigated the contribution of two related protein kinases,
      Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and the serum- and
      glucocorticoid-dependent kinase (Sgk), on insulin-induced ENaC activity in
      Fisher rat thyroid cells expressing ENaC. Overexpression of Akt1 or Sgk1
      significantly increased ENaC activity, whereas expression of a
      dominant-negative construct of Akt1, Akt1(K179M), decreased basal activity
      of ENaC. Inhibition of the endogenous expression of Akt1 and Sgk1 by short
      interfering RNA not only inhibited ENaC but also disrupted the stimulatory
      effect on ENaC of insulin and of the downstream effectors of insulin,
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PDK1. Conversely, overexpression of Akt1
      or Sgk1 increased expression of ENaC at the cell membrane and overcame the
      inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC. Furthermore, mutation of consensus
      phosphorylation sites on Nedd4-2 for Akt1 and Sgk1, Ser(342) and Ser(428),
      completely abolished the inhibitory effect of Sgk1 and Akt1 on Nedd4-2
      action. Together these data suggest that both Akt and Sgk are components
      of an insulin signaling pathway that increases Na(+) absorption by
      up-regulating membrane expression of ENaC via a regulatory system that
      involves inhibition of Nedd4-2.

TI  - 2-amino-N-{4-[5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-phe
      nyl} acetamide (OSU-03012), a celecoxib derivative, directly targets
      p21-activated kinase.
PG  - 1124-31
AB  - p21-Activated kinases (PAKs) are regulators of cell motility and
      proliferation. PAK activity is regulated in part by
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). We hypothesized that reduced
      PAK activity was involved in the effects of
      2-amino-N-{4-[5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-phe
      nyl} acetamide (OSU-03012), a previously characterized PDK1 inhibitor
      derived from celecoxib. In three human thyroid cancer cell lines,
      OSU-03012 inhibited cell proliferation with reduced AKT phosphorylation by
      PDK1. OSU-03012 unexpectedly inhibited PAK phosphorylation at lower
      concentrations than PDK1-dependent AKT phosphorylation in two of the three
      lines. In cell-free kinase assays, OSU-03012 was shown to inhibit PAK
      activity and compete with ATP binding. In addition, computer modeling
      predicted a docking site for OSU-03012 in the ATP binding motif of PAK1.
      Finally, overexpression of constitutively activated PAK1 partially rescued
      the ability of motile NPA thyroid cancer cells to migrate during OSU-03012
      treatment, suggesting that inhibition of PAK may be involved in the
      cellular effects of OSU-03012 in these cells. In summary, OSU-03012 is a
      direct inhibitor of PAK, and inhibition of PAK, either directly or
      indirectly, may be involved in its biological effects in vitro.

TI  - Notch-induced T cell development requires phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase 1.
PG  - 3441-50
AB  - Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase l (PDK1) phosphorylates and activates
      multiple AGC serine kinases, including protein kinase B (PKB),
      p70Ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and p90Ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). PDK1 is
      required for thymocyte differentiation and proliferation, and herein, we
      explore the molecular basis for these essential functions of PDK1 in T
      lymphocyte development. A key finding is that PDK1 is required for the
      expression of key nutrient receptors in T cell progenitors: CD71 the
      transferrin receptor and CD98 a subunit of L-amino acid transporters. PDK1
      is also essential for Notch-mediated trophic and proliferative responses
      in thymocytes. A PDK1 mutant PDK1 L155E, which supports activation of PKB
      but no other AGC kinases, can restore CD71 and CD98 expression in pre-T
      cells and restore thymocyte differentiation. However, PDK1 L155E is
      insufficient for thymocyte proliferation. The role of PDK1 in thymus
      development thus extends beyond its ability to regulate PKB. In addition,
      PDK1 phosphorylation of AGC kinases such as S6K and RSK is also necessary
      for thymocyte development.

TI  - Chemopreventive and bioenergetic signaling effects of PDK1/Akt pathway
      inhibition in a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer.
PG  - 549-61
AB  - The phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt pathway is an important
      regulator of multiple biological processes including cell growth,
      survival, and glucose metabolism. In light of the mechanistic link between
      Akt signaling and prostate tumorigenesis, we evaluated the chemopreventive
      relevance of inhibiting this pathway in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of
      the model prostate (TRAMP) mouse with OSU03012, a celecoxib-derived, but
      COX-2-inactive, PDK1 inhibitor. Beginning at ten weeks of age when
      prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions are well developed,
      TRAMP mice received OSU03012 via daily oral gavage for 8 weeks. The drug
      treatment significantly decreased the weight of all 4 prostate lobes as
      well as the grade of epithelial proliferation in the dorsal and lateral
      lobes compared to vehicle-treated control mice. The incidences of
      carcinoma and metastasis were decreased, although not to statistically
      significant levels. Treated mice lost body fat and failed to gain weight
      independent of food intake. This change and periportal hepatocellular
      atrophy can be linked to sustained PDK1 inhibition through downstream
      inactivation of glycogen synthase. Centrilobular hepatocellular
      hypertrophy and necrosis of Type II skeletal myofibers were also
      compound-related effects. We conclude that targeting of the PDK1/Akt
      pathway has chemopreventive relevance in prostate cancer and causes other
      in vivo effects mediated in part by an alteration of bioenergetic
      signaling.

TI  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase upregulates the dendritic translation
      machinery in long-term potentiation by controlling the mammalian target of
      rapamycin pathway.
PG  - 5885-94
AB  - Protein synthesis is required for persistent forms of synaptic plasticity,
      including long-term potentiation (LTP). A key regulator of LTP-related
      protein synthesis is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is
      thought to modulate translational capacity by facilitating the synthesis
      of particular components of the protein synthesis machinery. Recently,
      extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK) also was shown to mediate
      plasticity-related translation, an effect that may involve regulation of
      the mTOR pathway. We studied the interaction between the mTOR and ERK
      pathways in hippocampal LTP induced at CA3-CA1 synapses by high-frequency
      synaptic stimulation (HFS). Within minutes after HFS, the expression of
      multiple translational proteins, the synthesis of which is under the
      control of mTOR, increased in area CA1 stratum radiatum. This upregulation
      was detected in pyramidal cell dendrites and was blocked by inhibitors of
      the ERK pathway. In addition, ERK mediated the stimulation of mTOR by HFS.
      The possibility that ERK regulates mTOR by acting at a component further
      upstream in the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mTOR pathway was
      tested by probing the phosphorylation of p90-S6 kinase,
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), and Akt. ERK inhibitors
      blocked HFS-induced phosphorylation of all three proteins at sites
      implicated in the regulation of mTOR. Moreover, a component of basal and
      HFS-induced ERK activity depended on PI3K, indicating that mTOR-mediated
      protein synthesis in LTP requires coincident and mutually dependent
      activity in the PI3K and ERK pathways. The role of ERK in regulating PDK1
      and Akt, with their extensive effects on cellular function, has important
      implications for the coordinated response of the neuron to LTP-inducing
      stimulation.

      insulin-like growth factor-1 isoform (mIGF-1) to recover heart
      functionality, expressing the transgene in the mouse myocardium to exclude
      endocrine effects on other tissues. supplemental mIGF-1 expression did not
      perturb normal cardiac growth and physiology. Restoration of cardiac
      function in post-infarct mIGF-1 transgenic mice was facilitated by
      modulation of the inflammatory response and increased antiapoptotic
      signaling. mIGF-1 ventricular tissue exhibited increased proliferative
      activity several weeks after injury. The canonical signaling pathway
      involving Akt, mTOR, and p70S6 kinase was not induced in mIGF-1 hearts,
      which instead activated alternate PDK1 and SGK1 signaling intermediates.
      The robust response achieved with the mIGF-1 isoform provides a
      mechanistic basis for clinically feasible therapeutic strategies for
      improving the outcome of heart disease.

TI  - Reconstitution of modular PDK1 functions on trans-splicing of the
      regulatory PH and catalytic kinase domains.
PG  - 1294-302
AB  - The serine-threonine protein kinases PDK1 and PKB each contain a
      pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds the membrane-bound
      phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] second messenger and
      is required for PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation and activation of PKB.
      While X-ray structures have been reported for the individual regulatory PH
      and catalytic kinase domain constructs of both PDK1 and PKB, diffraction
      quality crystals of full length constructs have yet to be obtained, likely
      due to conformational heterogeneity. In developing alternative approaches
      to understanding the potential role of conformational dynamics in
      regulating PKB phosphorylation by PDK1, an efficient in vitro method for
      protein trans-splicing was developed, which utilizes the N- and C-terminal
      split inteins of the gene dnaE from Nostoc punctiforme [(N)NpuDnaE] and
      Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 [(C)SspDnaE], respectively. For
      conjugating the regulatory PH domain to the catalytic kinase domain of
      PDK1, the recombinant trans-splicing fusion constructs
      KINASE(AEY)-(N)NpuDnaE-His6 and GST-His6-(C)SspDnaE-(CMN)PH were designed,
      PCR assembled, overexpressed, and affinity purified. The cross-reacting
      (N)NpuDnaE and (C)SspDnaE inteins generated full length spliced-PDK1 with
      kobs = (2.8 +/- 0.3) x 10(-5) s(-1) and with < or =5% of any competing
      trans-cleavage reactions. Spliced-PDK1 was efficiently purified to > or
      =95% homogeneity from the reaction mixture by subsequent His6 affinity and
      ion exchange chromatography steps. In vitro kinase assays and
      phosphopeptide mapping studies confirmed that spliced-PDK1 retained the
      ability to colocalize and selectively phosphorylate Thr-309 of PKBbeta in
      a PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent manner. The high-level production and
      reconstitution of functional spliced-PDK1 establishes the feasibility of
      incorporating domain-specific biophysical probes for spectroscopic studies
      of regulatory PH domain mediated catalytic specificity.

TI  - Chrysin inhibited stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit complex-induced cell
      proliferation in human myeloid leukemia cells.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - Stem cell factor (SCF) has important roles in the proliferation and
      differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. The complex of c-Kit and its
      ligand SCF induce hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis.
      However, the mechanism by which SCF induces cell proliferation in the
      human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, MO7e, and the signaling
      molecules involved, especially in downstream signaling of c-Kit, remain
      unclear. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K pathway
      inhibits SCF/c-Kit signaling and cell proliferation. In addition, we find
      that the Shc/PDK1/PKC/Akt/c-raf signaling cascade is essential for
      SCF/c-Kit signal pathway. Our results also suggest that ERK5 is activated
      and translocated to the nucleus, activating CREB and STAT3. Interestingly,
      chrysin shuts down the SCF/c-Kit complex-induced signaling cascade. Taken
      together, these studies give additional insight into the molecular
      mechanism of SCF/c-Kit-induced cell proliferation and its inverse agonist,
      chrysin. Finally, these findings enhance our understanding of MO7e cell
      proliferation.

TI  - Manipulation of plant programmed cell death pathways during plant-pathogen
      interactions.
PG  - 188-9
AB  - The interaction of plants with bacterial pathogens involves the
      manipulation of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways. During a resistance
      interaction PCD is induced in a process termed the hypersensitive response
      (HR) which may function to limit pathogen spread. In a susceptible
      plant-pathogen interactions, the pathogen both inhibits and/or induces
      host PCD depending on the infection stage and lifestyle of the pathogen.
      Genes/pathways regulating PCD in plants have been difficult to identify
      due to a lack of homologous sequences in plants for mammalian genes that
      control apoptosis and possibly due to functional redundancy. Our labs
      study plant PCD pathways and bacterial speck disease in tomato which is
      caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). We recently identified
      the tomato protein kinases Pdk1 and Adi3 as negative regulators of plant
      PCD. The plant Pdk1/Adi3 pathway appears to function similarly to the
      Pdk1/PKB (Akt) pathway in mammals which functions as a major apoptosis
      negative regulation pathway. Here we discuss regulation of Pdk1/Adi3 and
      targeting of this pathway during the tomato-Pst interaction for modulation
      of host PCD.

TI  - Inactivation of Pten in osteo-chondroprogenitor cells leads to epiphyseal
      growth plate abnormalities and skeletal overgrowth.
PG  - 1245-59
AB  - To study the role of the Pten tumor suppressor in skeletogenesis, we
      generated mice lacking this key phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway
      regulator in their osteo-chondroprogenitors. A phenotype of growth plate
      dysfunction and skeletal overgrowth was observed. INTRODUCTION:
      Skeletogenesis is a complex process relying on a variety of ligands that
      activate a range of intracellular signal transduction pathways. Although
      many of these stimuli are known to activate phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase
      (PI3K), the function of this pathway during cartilage development remains
      nebulous. To study the role of PI3K during skeletogenesis, we used mice
      deficient in a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, the tumor suppressor,
      Pten. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pten gene deletion in
      osteo-chondrodroprogenitors was obtained by interbreeding mice with
      loxP-flanked Pten exons with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the
      control of the type II collagen gene promoter (Pten(flox/flox):Col2a1Cre
      mice). Phenotypic analyses included microcomputed tomography and
      immunohistochemistry techniques. RESULTS: MicroCT revealed that
      Pten(flox/flox):Col2a1Cre mice exhibited both increased skeletal size,
      particularly of vertebrae, and massive trabeculation accompanied by
      increased cortical thickness. Primary spongiosa development and
      perichondrial bone collar formation were prominent in
      Pten(flox/flox):Col2a1Cre mice, and long bone growth plates were
      disorganized and showed both matrix overproduction and evidence of
      accelerated hypertrophic differentiation (indicated by an altered pattern
      of type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase expression). Consistent with
      increased PI3K signaling, Pten-deficient chondrocytes showed increased
      phospho-PKB/Akt and phospho-S6 immunostaining, reflective of increased
      mTOR and PDK1 activity. Interestingly, no significant change in growth
      plate proliferation was seen in Pten-deficient mice, and growth plate
      fusion was found at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: By virtue of its ability to
      modulate a key signal transduction pathway responsible for integrating
      multiple stimuli, Pten represents an important regulator of both skeletal
      size and bone architecture.

TI  - Syndecan-1, a key regulator of cell viability in endometrial cancer.
PG  - 741-50
AB  - Syndecan-1 is one of the major proteoglycans on cell surfaces involved in
      major biological processes. Although loss of syndecan-1 correlates well
      with the gain of cancerous characteristics in a wide range of cancers,
      increased expression of syndecan-1 also coincides with adverse outcomes in
      some cancers, including breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. For this
      Janus-faced attitude of syndecan-1, we sought to examine expression
      patterns of syndecan-1 in endometrial carcinoma (EC) and gain insight into
      the roles of syndecan-1. Immunohistochemical examinations of 109
      endometrial tissue samples from myoma, hyperplasia and EC uteri revealed
      that syndecan-1 expression was significantly upregulated in EC compared
      with hyperplasia (p < 0.001). To evaluate pathophysiological functions of
      syndecan-1, its expression level was altered, and subsequent outcomes were
      examined using human endometrial cancer cell lines such as HEC-1A, AN3CA
      and KLE cells. Overexpression of syndecan-1 increased the growth of HEC-1A
      cells regardless of anchorage dependence while silencing syndecan-1 by
      antisense RNAs caused apoptotic cell death. Consistent with decreased
      viability, the loss of syndecan-1 was also accompanied by a decrease in
      the activation of Erk and Akt and a concomitant decrease in the
      phosphorylation of PTEN and PDK1, which are known as negative and positive
      regulators of Akt activation, respectively. These down-regulatory effects
      were reversed upon overexpression of syndecan-1. Collectively together,
      the aforementioned findings lend support to the notion that upregulation
      of syndecan-1 may be a critical element for endometrial cancers in
      maintaining their viability and thus can serve as a cancer specific
      therapeutic and diagnostic marker.

TI  - Rituximab inhibits the constitutively activated PI3K-Akt pathway in B-NHL
      cell lines: involvement in chemosensitization to drug-induced apoptosis.
PG  - 6184-93
AB  - Rituximab (chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) is currently being
      used, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in the treatment of
      B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). We have reported that rituximab
      treatment of B-NHL cell lines sensitizes the drug-resistant tumor cells to
      apoptosis by various chemotherapeutic drugs and chemosensitization was, in
      large part, owing to the selective inhibition of the anti-apoptotic
      Bcl-(XL) gene product. The constitutive activation of the Akt pathway in
      B-NHL results in overexpression and functional activation of Bcl-(xL).
      Hence, we hypothesized that rituximab-induced inhibition of Bcl-(xL)
      expression and chemosensitization may result, in part, from its inhibitory
      activity of the Akt pathway. This hypothesis was tested using the
      drug-resistant Ramos and Daudi B-NHL cell lines. Time kinetic analysis
      revealed that treatment with rituximab inhibited phosphorylation of Akt,
      but not unphosphorylated Akt, and the inhibition was first detected at 6 h
      post-rituximab treatment. Similar time kinetics revealed rituximab-induced
      inhibition of p-PDK1, p-Bad, p-IKKalpha/beta and p-Ikappabetaalpha and no
      inhibition of unphosphorylated proteins. In addition, rituximab treatment
      resulted in significant increase of Bcl-(xL)-Bad heterodimeric complexes
      as compared to untreated cells. The role of the Akt pathway in the
      regulation of resistance was corroborated by the use of the Akt inhibitor,
      LY294002, and by transfection with siRNA Akt. Treatment of tumor cells
      with LY294002 or with Akt siRNA, but not control siRNA, resulted in
      inhibition of Bcl-(xL) expression and sensitization to drug-induced
      apoptosis. Although rituximab did not inhibit the Akt pathway nor
      sensitized the rituximab-resistant Ramos RR1 clone, treatment with
      LY294002 or Akt siRNA sensitized the clone to drug-induced apoptosis. The
      present findings demonstrate for the first time that rituximab inhibits
      the constitutively activated Akt pathway in B-NHL cell lines, and this
      inhibition contributes to sensitization of drug-resistant cells to
      apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs. The findings also identify the Akt
      pathway as target for therapeutic intervention in the reversal of
      rituximab and drug-resistant B-NHL.

TI  - Intramolecular and intermolecular interactions of protein kinase B define
      its activation in vivo.
PG  - e95
AB  - Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is a pivotal regulator of diverse metabolic,
      phenotypic, and antiapoptotic cellular controls and has been shown to be a
      key player in cancer progression. Here, using fluorescent reporters, we
      shown in cells that, contrary to in vitro analyses,
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) is complexed to its
      substrate, PKB. The use of Forster resonance energy transfer detected by
      both frequency domain and two-photon time domain fluorescence lifetime
      imaging microscopy has lead to novel in vivo findings. The preactivation
      complex of PKB and PDK1 is maintained in an inactive state through a PKB
      intramolecular interaction between its pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase
      domains, in a "PH-in" conformer. This domain-domain interaction prevents
      the PKB activation loop from being phosphorylated by PDK1. The interactive
      regions for this intramolecular PKB interaction were predicted through
      molecular modeling and tested through mutagenesis, supporting the derived
      model. Physiologically, agonist-induced phosphorylation of PKB by PDK1
      occurs coincident to plasma membrane recruitment, and we further shown
      here that this process is associated with a conformational change in PKB
      at the membrane, producing a "PH-out" conformer and enabling PDK1 access
      the activation loop. The active, phosphorylated, "PH-out" conformer can
      dissociate from the membrane and retain this conformation to phosphorylate
      substrates distal to the membrane. These in vivo studies provide a new
      model for the mechanism of activation of PKB. This study takes a crucial
      widely studied regulator (physiology and pathology) and addresses the
      fundamental question of the dynamic in vivo behaviour of PKB with a
      detailed molecular mechanism. This has important implications not only in
      extending our understanding of this oncogenic protein kinase but also in
      opening up distinct opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Differential Pi3K-pathway activation in cortical tubers and focal cortical
      dysplasias with balloon cells.
PG  - 165-73
AB  - Balloon cells of distinct focal cortical dysplasias type IIb (FCD(IIb))
      and giant cells of cortical tubers in tuberous sclerosis (TSC) constitute
      neuropathological hallmarks and cytological similarities. In TSC, frequent
      mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes result in mTOR-signaling activity.
      Here, we addressed whether Pi3K-pathway activation differentiates balloon
      cells from giant cells. We used immunohistochemistry with antibodies
      against p-PDK1 (S241), p-Akt (S473), p-tuberin (T1462), p-p70(S6K) (T389),
      p-p70(S6K) (T229) and phalloidin-staining to analyze stress fiber
      formation in balloon cells of FCD(IIb) (n = 23) compared with cortical
      tuber giant cells (n = 5) and adjacent normal CNS tissue as control. We
      have further established an in vitro assay to assess potential
      phosphorylation between Akt and S6. We observed phosphorylated (p-)PDK1,
      p-Akt, p-tuberin, and p-p70-kDa S6-kinase (p-p70(S6K); residue T229) in
      balloon cells, whereas giant cells showed only equivalent levels of
      p-tuberin, p-p70(S6K) and stress fibers. Furthermore, Pi3K-cascade
      activity in balloon cells may reflect pathway "cross-talk". An in vitro
      assay revealed S6, a major target of p70(S6K), to increase phosphorylation
      of Akt. Our data suggest recruitment of different Pi3K-cascade factors in
      the molecular pathogenesis of giant cells in cortical tubers vs. balloon
      cells in FCD(IIb) and provides new implications for the development of
      treatment strategies for these cortical malformations.

TI  - The MAPK pathway and HIF-1 are involved in the induction of the human
      PAI-1 gene expression by insulin in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2.
PG  - 355-67
AB  - Enhanced levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are
      considered to be a risk factor for pathological conditions associated with
      hypoxia or hyperinsulinemia. The expression of the PAI-1 gene is increased
      by insulin in different cells, although, the molecular mechanisms behind
      insulin-induced PAI-1 expression are not fully known yet. Here, we show
      that insulin upregulates human PAI-1 gene expression and promoter activity
      in HepG2 cells and that mutation of the hypoxia-responsive element
      (HRE)-binding hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) abolished the insulin
      effects. Mutation of E-boxes E4 and E5 abolished the insulin-dependent
      activation of the PAI-1 promoter only under normoxia, but did not affect
      it under hypoxia. Furthermore, the insulin effect was associated with
      activation of HIF-1alpha via mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) but
      not PDK1 and PKB in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, mutation of a putative FoxO1
      binding site which was supposed to be involved in insulin-dependent PAI-1
      gene expression influenced the insulin-dependent activation only under
      normoxia. Thus, insulin-dependent PAI-1 gene expression might be regulated
      by the action of both HIF-1 and FoxO1 transcription factors.

TI  - Essential role of PDK1 in regulating endothelial cell migration.
PG  - 1035-47
AB  - The serine/threonine protein kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
      (PDK1) plays a central role in cellular signaling by phosphorylating
      members of the AGC family of kinases, including PKB/Akt. We now present
      evidence showing that PDK1 is essential for the motility of vascular
      endothelial cells (ECs) and that it is involved in the regulation of their
      chemotaxis. ECs differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells lacking
      PDK1 completely lost their ability to migrate in vitro in response to
      vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). In addition, PDK1(-/-)
      embryoid bodies exhibit evident developmental and vascular defects that
      can be attributed to a reduced cell migration. Moreover, the
      overexpression of PDK1 increased the EC migration induced by VEGF-A. We
      propose a model of spatial distribution of PDK1 and Akt in which the
      synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate at plasma membrane by
      activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase recruits both proteins at the
      leading edge of the polarized ECs and promotes cell chemotaxis. These
      findings establish a mechanism for the spatial localization of PDK1 and
      its substrate Akt to regulate directional migration.

TI  - Re-evaluating AKT regulation: role of TOR complex 2 in tissue growth.
PG  - 632-7
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling is essential for growth
      and metabolism and is elevated in many cancers. Enzymatic activity of AKT
      has been shown to depend on phosphorylation of two conserved sites by PDK1
      and TOR (target of rapamycin) complex 2 (TORC2) in a PI3K-dependent
      manner. Here we analyze the role of TORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation in
      Drosophila. Mutants removing critical TORC2 components, rictor and sin1,
      strongly reduced AKT hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation and AKT
      activity, but showed only minor growth impairment. A mutant form of AKT
      lacking the HM phosphorylation site displayed comparable activity. In
      contrast to the mild effects of removing HM site phosphorylation at normal
      levels of PI3K activity, loss of TORC2 activity strongly inhibited
      hyperplasia caused by elevated pathway activity, as in mutants of the
      tumor suppressor PTEN. Thus, TORC2 acts as a rheostat to broaden the range
      of AKT signaling at the high end of its range.

TI  - Apoptosis and inactivation of the PI3-kinase pathway by tetrocarcin A in
      breast cancers.
PG  - 260-5
AB  - A survival kinase, Akt, is a downstream factor in the
      phosphatidylinositide-3'-kinase-dependent pathway, which mediates many
      biological responses including glucose uptake, protein synthesis and the
      regulation of proliferation and apoptosis, which is assumed to contribute
      to acquisition of malignant properties of human cancers. Here we find that
      an anti-tumor antibiotic, tetrocarcin A, directly induces apoptosis of
      human breast cancer cells. The apoptosis is accompanied by the activation
      of a proteolytic cascade of caspases including caspase-3 and -9, and
      concomitantly decreases phosphorylation of Akt, PDK1, and PTEN, a tumor
      suppressor that regulates the activity of Akt through the
      dephosphorylation of polyphosphoinositides. Tetrocarcin A affected neither
      expression of Akt, PDK1, or PTEN, nor did it affect the expression of Bcl
      family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Bax. These results suggest
      that tetrocarcin A could be a potent chemotherapeutic agent for human
      breast cancer targeting the phosphatidylinositide-3'-kinase/Akt signaling
      pathway.

TI  - IGF-I-induced oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation requires PI3K/Akt,
      MEK/ERK, and Src-like tyrosine kinases.
PG  - 1480-93
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is required for the growth of
      oligodendrocytes, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully
      understood. Our aim was to investigate the role of phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1), and Src
      family tyrosine kinases in IGF-I-stimulated proliferation of
      oligodendrocyte progenitors. IGF-I treatment increased the proliferation
      of cultured oligodendrocyte progenitors as determined by measuring
      incorporation of [(3)H]-thymidine and bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdU). IGF-I
      stimulated a transient phosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase-1 (PDK1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2)
      (targets of MEK1), as well as a rapid and sustained activation of Akt (a
      target of PI3K). Furthermore, inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 and
      Wortmannin), MEK1 (PD98059 and U0126), and Src family tyrosine kinases
      (PP2) decreased IGF-I-induced proliferation, and blocked ERK1/2
      activation. LY294002, Wortmannin and PP2 also blocked Akt activation. To
      further determine whether Akt is required for IGF-I stimulated
      oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation, cultures were infected with
      adenovirus vectors expressing dominant-negative mutants of Akt or treated
      with pharmacological inhibitors of Akt. All treatments reduced
      IGF-I-induced oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation. Our data indicate
      that stimulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation by IGF-I
      requires Src-like tyrosine kinases as well as the PI3K/Akt and MEK1/ERK
      signaling pathways.

TI  - Dissociation between the translocation and the activation of Akt in
      fMLP-stimulated human neutrophils--effect of prostaglandin E2.
PG  - 1523-34
AB  - PGE(2) and other cAMP-elevating agents are known to down-regulate most
      functions stimulated by fMLP in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. We
      reported previously that the inhibitory potential of PGE(2) resides in its
      capacity to suppress fMLP-stimulated PI-3Kgamma activation via the PGE(2)
      receptor EP(2) and hence, to decrease phosphatidylinositol
      3,4,5-triphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P(3)] formation. Akt activity is stimulated
      by fMLP through phosphorylation on threonine 308 (Thr308) and serine 473
      (Ser473) by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and MAPK-AP
      kinase (APK)-APK-2 (MAPKAPK-2), respectively, in a PI-3K-dependent manner.
      Despite the suppression of fMLP-induced PI-3Kgamma activation observed in
      the presence of PGE(2), we show that Akt is fully phosphorylated on Thr308
      and Ser473. However, fMLP-induced Akt translocation is decreased markedly
      in this context. PGE(2) does not affect the phosphorylation of MAPKAPK-2
      but decreases the translocation of PDK1 induced by fMLP. Other
      cAMP-elevating agents such as adenosine (Ado) similarly block the
      fMLP-induced PI-3Kgamma activation process but do not inhibit Akt
      phosphorylation. However, Akt activity stimulated by fMLP is
      down-regulated slightly by agonists that elevate cAMP levels. Whereas
      protein kinase A is not involved in the maintenance of Akt
      phosphorylation, it is required for the inhibition of Akt translocation by
      PGE(2). Moreover, inhibition of fMLP-stimulated PI-3Kdelta activity by the
      selective inhibitor IC87114 only partially affects the late phase of Akt
      phosphorylation in the presence of PGE(2). Taken together, these results
      suggest that cAMP-elevating agents, such as PGE(2) or Ado, are able to
      induce an alternative mechanism of Akt activation by fMLP in which the
      translocation of Akt to PI(3,4,5)P(3)-enriched membranes is not required
      prior to its phosphorylation.

TI  - 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent PDK1 negatively regulates transforming growth
      factor-beta-induced signaling in a kinase-dependent manner through
      physical interaction with Smad proteins.
PG  - 12272-89
AB  - We have reported previously that PDK1 physically interacts with STRAP, a
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor-interacting protein,
      and enhances STRAP-induced inhibition of TGF-beta signaling. In this study
      we show that PDK1 coimmunoprecipitates with Smad proteins, including
      Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7, and that this association is mediated by
      the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1. The association between PDK1 and
      Smad proteins is increased by insulin treatment but decreased by TGF-beta
      treatment. Analysis of the interacting proteins shows that Smad proteins
      enhance PDK1 kinase activity by removing 14-3-3, a negative regulator of
      PDK1, from the PDK1-14-3-3 complex. Knockdown of endogenous Smad proteins,
      including Smad3 and Smad7, by transfection with small interfering RNA
      produced the opposite trend and decreased PDK1 activity, protein kinase
      B/Akt phosphorylation, and Bad phosphorylation. Moreover, coexpression of
      Smad proteins and wild-type PDK1 inhibits TGF-beta-induced transcription,
      as well as TGF-beta-mediated biological functions, such as apoptosis and
      cell growth arrest. Inhibition was dose-dependent on PDK1, but no
      inhibition was observed in the presence of an inactive kinase-dead PDK1
      mutant. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that wild-type PDK1
      prevents translocation of Smad3 and Smad4 from the cytoplasm to the
      nucleus, as well as the redistribution of Smad7 from the nucleus to the
      cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Taken together, our results suggest
      that PDK1 negatively regulates TGF-beta-mediated signaling in a PDK1
      kinase-dependent manner via a direct physical interaction with Smad
      proteins and that Smad proteins can act as potential positive regulators
      of PDK1.

TI  - Hdac2 regulates the cardiac hypertrophic response by modulating Gsk3 beta
      activity.
PG  - 324-31
AB  - In the adult heart, a variety of stresses induce re-expression of a fetal
      gene program in association with myocyte hypertrophy and heart failure.
      Here we show that histone deacetylase-2 (Hdac2) regulates expression of
      many fetal cardiac isoforms. Hdac2 deficiency or chemical histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition prevented the re-expression of fetal genes
      and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in hearts exposed to hypertrophic
      stimuli. Resistance to hypertrophy was associated with increased
      expression of the gene encoding inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase f
      (Inpp5f) resulting in constitutive activation of glycogen synthase kinase
      3beta (Gsk3beta) via inactivation of thymoma viral proto-oncogene (Akt)
      and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1). In contrast,
      Hdac2 transgenic mice had augmented hypertrophy associated with
      inactivated Gsk3beta. Chemical inhibition of activated Gsk3beta allowed
      Hdac2-deficient adults to become sensitive to hypertrophic stimulation.
      These results suggest that Hdac2 is an important molecular target of HDAC
      inhibitors in the heart and that Hdac2 and Gsk3beta are components of a
      regulatory pathway providing an attractive therapeutic target for the
      treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

TI  - Phosphoinositide-3-kinase/akt survival signal pathways are implicated in
      neuronal survival after stroke.
PG  - 249-70
AB  - In recent years, the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt cell survival signaling
      pathway has been increasingly researched in the field of stroke. Akt
      activity is suggested to be upregulated by phosphorylation through the
      activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors. Although the
      upstream signaling components phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase
      (PDK)1 and integrinlinked kinase enhance the activity of Akt, phosphatase
      and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) decreases it. Upon
      activation, Akt phosphorylates an array of molecules, including glycogen
      synthase kinase3beta (GSK3beta), forkhead homolog in rhabdomyosarcoma
      (FKHR), and Bcl-2-associated death protein, thereby blocking mitochondrial
      cytochrome c release and caspase activity. Generally, the level of Akt
      phosphorylation at site Ser 473 (P-Akt) transiently increases after focal
      ischemia, whereas the levels of phosphorylation of PTEN, PDK1, forkhead
      transcription factor, and GSK3beta decrease. Numerous compounds (such as
      growth factors, estrogen, free radical scavengers, and other
      neuroprotectants) reduce ischemic damage, possibly by upregulating P-Akt.
      However, preconditioning and hypothermia block ischemic damage by
      inhibiting an increase of P-Akt. Inhibition of the Akt pathway blocks the
      protective effect of preconditioning and hypothermia, suggesting the Akt
      pathway contributes to their protective effects and that the P-Akt level
      does not represent its true kinase activity. Together, attenuation of the
      Akt pathway dysfunction contributes to neuronal survival after stroke.

      inhibitor 9-chloro-2-methylellipticinium acetate (CMEP) in breast cancer
      cells.
PG  - 244-58
AB  - AKT is a promising target for anticancer drug development. In this work, a
      bioinformatics approach was applied to search for AKT inhibitors based on
      the correlation analysis between phospho-Ser473 AKT expression level and
      the antiproliferative data of NCI small molecule compounds against NCI 60
      cancer cell lines, the candidate compounds were then subject to AKT kinase
      assay. The possible effects of potent compound on PI3K/AKT, PDK1, and
      MAPK, its antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on breast
      cancer cells which have high-levels of AKT activation were assessed by
      Western blot analysis, cell viability assay, and apoptosis assay. One
      compound, CMEP (NSC632855, 9-chloro-2-methylellipticinium acetate) was
      identified with all three correlation algorithm, Pearson's, Sperman's, and
      Kendall's, showing a high-ranked correlation coefficient. CMEP inhibits
      only AKT, but does not inhibit PI3K, PDK1, or MAPK. CMEP also inhibits
      heregulin-induced AKT activation, does not inhibit heregulin-induced MAPK
      activation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Increased concentrations of ATP
      reverse the AKT inhibitory effect of CMEP. CMEP inhibits growth and
      induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells which have high-levels of AKT
      activation and lack functional PTEN; however, CMEP only shows a minimal
      activity in NIH3T3 cells which do not have AKT activation. In conclusion,
      a lead compound CMEP, as an AKT selective inhibitor has been identified
      started with a bioinformatics-based approach. CMEP inhibits growth and
      induces apoptosis in cancer cells which have high-levels of AKT activation
      and lack PTEN or harbor PTEN mutation.

TI  - Protein kinase CK2alpha as an unfavorable prognostic marker and novel
      therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1019-28
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Protein kinase CK2 is implicated in cellular proliferation
      and transformation. However, the clinical and biological significances of
      CK2 have not been elucidated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL
      DESIGN: We evaluated the biological significances of catalytic subunit of
      CK2 (CK2alpha) expression in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic
      blasts obtained from AML patients. RESULTS: In this study, the expression
      of CK2alpha was elevated in a substantial proportion of AML. In AML
      patients with normal karyotype, the disease-free survival and overall
      survival rates were significantly lower in the CK2alpha-high compared with
      the CK2alpha-low AML cases (P=0.0252 and P=0.0392, respectively). An
      induced overexpression of CK2alpha increased the levels of Ser473
      phosphorylated (p)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), p-PDK1, pFKHR, p-BAD,
      Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and XIAP. Treatment of U937 cell line and primary
      AML blasts with selective CK2 inhibitor, tetrabromobenzotriazole or
      apigenin, reduced the levels of these molecules in a dose-dependent
      manner. CK2alpha small interfering RNA treatment also resulted in a
      down-regulation of p-Akt/PKB and Bcl-2 in U937 cells. Apigenin-induced
      cell death was preferentially observed in the CK2alpha-high leukemia cell
      lines, HL-60 and NB4, which was accompanied by cytoplasmic release of
      SMAC/DIABLO and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-9, procaspase-3,
      procaspase-8, and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. An induced overexpression of
      CK2alpha potentially enhanced the sensitivity of U937 cells to the
      apigenin-induced cell death. Apigenin-induced cell death was significantly
      higher in CK2alpha-high AML compared with CK2alpha-low AML (P<0.0001) or
      normal bone marrow samples (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: These findings strongly
      suggest protein kinase CK2alpha as an unfavorable prognostic marker and
      novel therapeutic target in AML.

TI  - Endothelial cell-pericyte cocultures induce PLA2 protein expression
      through activation of PKCalpha and the MAPK/ERK cascade.
PG  - 782-93
AB  - Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of endothelial cell (EC)
      proliferation by retinal pericytes and vice versa. In a model of coculture
      with bovine retinal pericytes lasting for 24 h, rat brain ECs showed an
      increase in arachidonic acid (AA) release, whereas Western blot and RT-PCR
      analyses revealed that ECs activated the protein expression of cytosolic
      phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and its phosphorylated form and
      calcium-independent intracellular phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)). No
      activation of the same enzymes was seen in companion pericytes. In ECs,
      the protein level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
      (ERK) 1/2 was also enhanced significantly, a finding not observed in
      cocultured pericytes. The expression of protein kinase C-alpha (PKCalpha)
      and its phosphorylated form was also enhanced in ECs. Wortmannin,
      LY294002, and PD98059, used as inhibitors of upstream kinases (the
      PI3-kinase/Akt/PDK1 or MEK-1 pathway) in cultures, markedly attenuated AA
      release and the expression of phosphorylated forms of endothelial cPLA(2),
      PKCalpha, and ERK1/2. By confocal microscopy, activation of PKCalpha in
      perinuclear regions of ECs grown in coculture as well as strong activation
      of cPLA(2) in ECs taken from a model of mixed culture were clearly
      observed. However, no increased expression of both enzymes was found in
      cocultured pericytes. Our findings indicate that a sequential activation
      of PKCalpha contributes to endothelial ERK1/2 and cPLA(2) phosphorylation
      induced by either soluble factors or direct cell-to-cell contact, and that
      the PKCalpha-cPLA(2) pathway appears to play a key role in the early phase
      of EC-pericyte interactions regulating blood retina or blood-brain barrier
      maturation.

TI  - Restoration of glucokinase expression in the liver normalizes postprandial
      glucose disposal in mice with hepatic deficiency of PDK1.
PG  - 1000-9
AB  - Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is implicated in the metabolic
      effects of insulin as a key mediator of phosphoinositide
      3-kinase-dependent signaling. Here we show that mice with liver-specific
      PDK1 deficiency manifest various defects in the metabolic actions of
      insulin in the liver as well as a type 2 diabetes-like phenotype
      characterized by marked hyperinsulinemia and postprandial hyperglycemia.
      The hepatic abundance of glucokinase, an important determinant of glucose
      flux and glucose-evoked signaling in hepatocytes, was substantially
      reduced in these mice. Restoration of hepatic glucokinase expression, with
      the use of an adenoviral vector, induced insulin-like effects in the liver
      and almost completely normalized the fasting hyperinsulinemia and
      postprandial hyperglycemia in these animals. These results indicate that,
      if the hepatic abundance of glucokinase is maintained, ingested glucose is
      normally disposed of even in the absence of acute activation of proximal
      insulin signaling, such as the activation of Akt, in the liver.

TI  - Selective gene activation by spatial segregation of insulin receptor B
      signaling.
PG  - 1609-21
AB  - Insulin exerts pleiotropic effects at the cellular level. Signaling via
      the two isoforms of the insulin receptor (IR) may explain the activation
      of different signaling cascades, while it remains to be explored how
      selectivity is achieved when utilizing the same IR isoform. We now
      demonstrate that insulin-stimulated transcription of c-fos and glucokinase
      genes is activated simultaneously in the insulin-producing beta-cell via
      IR-B localized in different cellular compartments. Insulin activates the
      glucokinase gene from plasma membrane-standing IR-B, while c-fos gene
      activation is dependent on clathrin-mediated IR-B-endocytosis and
      signaling from early endosomes. Moreover, glucokinase gene up-regulation
      requires the integrity of the juxtamembrane IR-B NPEY-motif and signaling
      via PI3K-C2alpha-like/PDK1/PKB, while c-fos gene activation requires the
      intact C-terminal YTHM-motif and signaling via PI3K Ia/Shc/MEK1/ERK. By
      using IR-B as an example it is thus possible to demonstrate how spatial
      segregation allows simultaneous and selective signaling via the same
      receptor isoform in the same cell.

TI  - Abnormal glucose homeostasis in adult female rat offspring after
      intrauterine ethanol exposure.
PG  - R1926-33
AB  - Adverse events during pregnancy, including prenatal ethanol (EtOH)
      exposure, are associated with insulin-resistant diabetes in male rat
      offspring, but it is unclear whether this is true for female offspring. We
      investigated whether prenatal EtOH exposure alters glucose metabolism in
      adult female rat offspring and whether this is associated with reduced in
      vivo insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were
      given EtOH, 4 g.kg(-1).day(-1) by gavage throughout pregnancy. Glucose
      tolerance test and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were performed, and
      insulin signaling was investigated in skeletal muscle, in adult female
      offspring. We gave insulin intravenously to these rats and determined the
      association of glucose transporter-4 with plasma membranes, as well as the
      phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1),
      Akt, and PKCzeta. Although EtOH offspring had normal birth weight, they
      were overweight as adults and had fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia,
      and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. After insulin treatment,
      EtOH-exposed rats had decreased membrane glucose transporter-4, PDK1, Akt,
      and PKCzeta in the gastrocnemius muscle, compared with control rats.
      Insulin stimulation of PDK1, Akt, and PKCzeta phosphorylation was also
      reduced. In addition, the expression of the protein tribbles-3 and the
      phosphatase enzyme activity of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on
      chromosome 10 (PTEN), which prevent Akt activation, were increased in
      muscle from EtOH-exposed rats. Female rat offspring exposed to EtOH in
      utero develop insulin-resistant diabetes in association with excessive
      PTEN and tribbles-3 signaling downstream of the phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase pathway in skeletal muscle, which may be a mechanism for the
      abnormal glucose tolerance.

TI  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway regulates sperm viability but not
      capacitation on boar spermatozoa.
PG  - 1035-42
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) plays an important role in cell
      survival in somatic cells and recent data pointed out a role for this
      kinase in sperm capacitation and acrosome reaction (AR). This study was
      undertaken to evaluate the role of PI3-K pathway on porcine spermatozoa
      capacitation, AR, and viability using two unrelated PI3-K inhibitors,
      LY294002 and wortmannin. In boar spermatozoa, we have identified the
      presence of PDK1, PKB/Akt, and PTEN, three of the main key components of
      the PI3-K pathway. Incubation of boar sperm in a capacitating medium (TCM)
      caused a significant increase in the percentage of capacitated (25 +/- 2
      to 34 +/- 1% P < 0.05, n = 6) and acrosome reacted (1 +/- 1 to 11 +/- 1% P
      < 0.01, n = 6) spermatozoa compared with sperm in basal medium (TBM).
      Inhibition of PI3-K did affect neither the capacitation status nor AR nor
      protein p32 tyrosine phosphorylation of boar spermatozoa incubated in TBM
      or TCM. Boar sperm viability in TBM was significantly decreased by 40 and
      20% after pretreatment with LY294002 or wortmannin, respectively. Similar
      results were observed after incubation of boar spermatozoa in TCM.
      Treatment of boar spermatozoa with the analog of cAMP, 8Br-cAMP
      significantly prevented the reduction on sperm viability. Our results
      provide evidence for an important role of the PI3-K pathway in the
      regulation of boar sperm viability and suggests that other signaling
      pathways different from PI3-K must be activated downstream of cAMP to
      contribute to regulation of sperm viability. Finally, in our conditions
      the PI3-K pathway seems not related with boar sperm capacitation or AR.

TI  - A Lupinoside prevented fatty acid induced inhibition of insulin
      sensitivity in 3T3 L1 adipocytes.
PG  - 149-57
AB  - The decrease in insulin sensitivity to target tissues or insulin
      resistance leads to type 2 diabetes mellitus, an insidious disease
      threatening global health. Numerous evidences made free fatty acids (FFAs)
      responsible for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We demonstrate
      here that the damage of insulin acitivity by a free fatty acid, palmitate
      could be prevented by a lupinoside. An incubation of 3T3 L1 adipocytes
      with a FFA i.e. palmitate inhibited insulin stimulated uptake of (3)H-2
      deoxyglucose (2 DOG) significantly. Addition of a lupinoside purified from
      Pueraria tuberosa, lupinoside PA(4) (LPA(4)) strongly prevented this
      inhibition. We then examined insulin signaling pathway where palmitate
      significantly inhibited insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Insulin
      receptor tyrosine kinase, IRS 1and PI3 kinase, PDK1 and Akt/PKB. LPA(4)
      rescued this inhibition of signaling molecule by palmitate. Insulin
      mediated translocation of Glut4, the glucose transporter in insulin target
      cells, was effectively blocked by palmitate while, LPA(4) waived this
      block. Administration of LPA(4) to nutritionally induced diabetic rats
      significantly reduced the increase in plasma glucose. All these indicate
      LPA(4) to be a potentially therapeutic agent for insulin resistance and
      type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Investigation of interleukin 1beta-mediated regulation of NF-kappaB
      activation in colonic cells reveals divergence between PKB and
      PDK-transduced events.
PG  - 113-27
AB  - Recent work has highlighted a role for PDK1 in adaptive immunity, however
      its contribution to innate immunity has not been addressed. We have
      investigated the role of PKB and PDK1 in IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB
      activation. Over-expression of either in HCT 116 and HEK 293T cells,
      effected a reproducible NF-kappaB activation. This was validated in a
      one-hybrid assay utilizing Gal4-RelA and Gal4-luciferase assay. N-tosyl
      phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), wortmannin and Ly294002 inhibited
      IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activation in both systems indicating
      involvement of the PI3K axis in this response. p65 (Rel A) Ser536
      phosphorylation was not affected by the PI3K inhibitors but was
      dose-dependently attenuated by TPCK. Evaluation of IKK-associated activity
      using GST-p65 substrate phosphorylation in immune complex assays, revealed
      that whilst TPCK attenuated this, neither of the PI3K inhibitors had any
      effect. Furthermore whilst TPCK inhibited IL-1beta-induced p65 DNA
      binding, this was not apparent with either of wortmannin or Ly294002.
      Similarly, over-expression of PDK1 but not PKB resulted in promotion of
      p65 DNA binding. Using a p65-S536A reporter construct, we found inhibition
      of only PDK1 over-expression-induced, but not PKB over-expression-induced
      NF-kappaB activation. This was supported using biochemical analysis in
      which immunoprecipitated IKKgamma from IL-1beta-activated cells was unable
      to phosphorylate a p65-S536A substrate, confirming this as the dominant
      IKK-dependent site. In further support of a dissociated response, we
      observed an attenuation of the Ser177/181 IKK phosphorylation by TPCK but
      not in response to PI3K inhibition. Our data reveals for the first time
      that PDK1 and PKB may differentially activate NF-kappaB, and that TPCK may
      subserve a useful anti-inflammatory function by inhibiting IKKbeta.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms involved in differentiated thyroid cancer invasion
      and metastasis.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The majority of patients with thyroid cancer have an
      excellent prognosis, however patients with extensive local invasion and
      distant metastasis frequently do not respond to standard treatments and
      have worsened prognosis. Understanding the specific mechanisms involved in
      thyroid cancer invasion and metastasis is critical in order to develop new
      treatments specifically targeted for these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The
      genetic basis for thyroid cancer initiation and development is well
      characterized, with the majority of studies implicating activation of the
      RAS-RAF-ERK and PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathways. Over the last several
      years, data from a concerted effort to define the pathways involved in
      invasion and metastasis suggest that reactivation of embryonic pathways
      involved in cell movement, to include epithelial to mesenchymal transition
      and collective cell migration, may be involved in cancer cell migration
      and invasion. The previously identified thyroid oncogenes, BRAF, RET/PTC
      and Ras, appear to be important regulators of this process. SUMMARY: The
      molecular mechanisms that control cell migration during embryological
      development, such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition, appear to be
      reactivated in invading thyroid cancer cells. Elucidation of the
      signal-transduction networks and molecules that are involved in thyroid
      cancer invasion may lead to novel therapeutic targets.

TI  - Akt-PDK1 complex mediates epidermal growth factor-induced membrane
      protrusion through Ral activation.
PG  - 119-28
AB  - We studied the spatiotemporal regulation of Akt (also called protein
      kinase B), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P2], and
      phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] by using probes
      based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. On
      epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, the amount of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3
      was increased diffusely in the plasma membrane, whereas that of
      PtdIns(3,4)P2 was increased more in the nascent lamellipodia than in the
      plasma membrane of the central region. The distribution and time course of
      Akt activation were similar to that of increased PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels,
      which were most prominent in the nascent lamellipodia. Moreover, we found
      that upon EGF stimulation 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1
      (PDK1) was also recruited to nascent lamellipodia in an Akt-dependent
      manner. Because PDK1 is known to activate Ral GTPase and because Ral is
      required for EGF-induced lamellipodial protrusion, we speculated that the
      PDK1-Akt complex may be indispensable for the induction of lamellipodia.
      In agreement with this idea, EGF-induced lamellipodia formation was
      promoted by the overexpression of Akt and inhibited by an Akt inhibitor or
      a Ral-binding domain of Sec5. These results identified the Akt-PDK1
      complex as an upstream positive regulator of Ral GTPase in the induction
      of lamellipodial protrusion.

TI  - 3'Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 is essential for ischemic
      preconditioning of the myocardium.
PG  - 2556-8
AB  - Brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion that precede sustained ischemia
      lead to a reduction in myocardial infarct size. This phenomenon, known as
      ischemic preconditioning, is mediated by signaling pathway(s) that are yet
      to be fully defined. 3'-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) has
      been implicated in numerous cellular processes. However, the involvement
      of PDK1 in preconditioning has yet to be elucidated. Studying PDK1 is not
      as straightforward as it is for the majority of kinases, due to the lack
      of a specific inhibitor of PDK1. Therefore, we have taken advantage of
      PDK1 hypomorphic mutant mice with reduced expression of PDK1 to study the
      role of PDK1 in preconditioning. Whole heart and single cell models of
      preconditioning demonstrated that the hearts and cardiac cells from PDK1
      hypomorphic mice could not be preconditioned. The cardioprotective effect
      of PDK1 was not related to the effect that preconditioning has on
      sarcolemmal membrane action potential as revealed by di-8-ANEPPS, a
      sarcolemmal-potential sensitive dye, and laser confocal microscopy. In
      contrast, experiments with JC-1, a mitochondrial membrane
      potential-sensitive dye, has demonstrated that intact PDK1 levels were
      required for preconditioning-mediated regulation of mitochondrial membrane
      potential. Western blotting combined with functional experiments have
      shown that intact PDK1 levels were required for preconditioning-induced
      phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta
      (GSK-3beta), and cardioprotection. We conclude that PDK1 mediates
      preconditioning in the heart by regulating activating PKB-GSK-3beta to
      regulate mitochondrial but not sarcolemmal membrane potential.
      3'Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is essential for ischemic
      preconditioning of the myocardium.

      transport and glycogen synthesis. In this study, we investigated the
      possibility that PKCdelta may be involved in insulin-induced activation of
      PKB. Studies were conducted on primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle.
      PKB was activated by insulin stimulation within 5min and reached a peak by
      15-30min. Insulin also increased the physical association between PKCdelta
      with PKB and with PDK1. The insulin-induced PKCdelta-PKB association was
      PI3K dependent. PKB-PKCdelta association was accounted for by the
      involvement of PDK1. Overexpression of dominant negative PKCdelta
      abrogated insulin-induced association of PKCdelta with both PKB and PDK1.
      Blockade of PKCdelta also decreased insulin-induced Thr308 PKB
      phosphorylation and PKB translocation. Moreover, PKCdelta inhibition
      reduced insulin-induced GSK3 phosphorylation. The results indicate that
      insulin-activated PKCdelta interacts with PDK1 to regulate PKB.

TI  - Blockade of AKT activation in prostate cancer cells with a small molecule
      inhibitor, 9-chloro-2-methylellipticinium acetate (CMEP).
PG  - 15-24
AB  - AKT inhibitors are potentially promising drug candidates for the treatment
      of cancer. The inhibitory effects of a potent and selective AKT/BKB small
      molecule inhibitor, 9-chloro-2-methylellipticinium acetate (CMEP), on the
      activation of AKT, its antiproliferation and apoptosis-inducing effects in
      prostate cancer cell lines: DU-145, PC-3, LNCaP, and CL-1, an
      androgen-independent LNCaP variant, and CL-1 xenograft mouse model were
      assessed by Western blot analysis, kinase assay, cell survival assay, and
      apoptosis assay in this report. It has been observed that the expression
      levels of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 vary, but the levels of phospho-Ser473 AKT
      and phospho-Thr308 AKT are quite unique in these cancer cell lines, and
      that CL-1 cells have the highest basal levels of AKT activation among
      these cell lines. In PC-3 cells, CMEP has been found to inhibit only AKT
      activation at both normal and serum-starvation conditions, not to inhibit
      PI3K, PDK1, or MAPK. More importantly, it has been discovered that CMEP
      inhibits cell proliferation, and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer
      cells which have high-levels of AKT activation and lack PTEN or harbor
      PTEN mutation, such as CL-1, LNCaP, and PC-3; only shows a minimal
      activity in DU-145 cancer cells which do not have AKT activation.
      Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CMEP treatment inhibits
      phospho-Ser473 AKT and phospho-p70S6K while stimulating TSC2 in the tumor
      tissue from CL-1-bearing mice. In conclusion, by specific blockade of the
      activation of AKT, CMEP preferentially inhibits growth and induces
      apoptosis in prostate cancer cells which have high-levels of AKT
      activation.

TI  - Requirement for Akt-mediated survival in cell transformation by the dbl
      oncogene.
PG  - 211-8
AB  - The dbl oncogene product is the founding member of a large family of
      oncogenic proteins that function by activating the small GTP-binding
      proteins Cdc42, Rac and Rho. Through its substrate GTPases, Dbl transduces
      proliferative signals from cell-surface receptors to diverse cellular
      effectors and signaling pathways. The mechanisms by which these multiple
      signals are integrated, as well as their relative contribution to
      Dbl-induced cell transformation, are presently poorly understood. We
      investigated the role of the survival regulators PI3-kinase and Akt in
      Dbl-induced cell transformation. We found that Dbl induced the
      phosphorylation of Akt on threonine 308, through the GTPases Rac and Cdc42
      and in a PI3-kinase dependent manner. Pharmacological or biochemical
      interference with this pathway lead to a marked, dose-dependent inhibition
      of the focus formation activity exhibited by Dbl-expressing cells. Dbl
      expression stimulated the phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic Akt
      substrate Bad, and caused a marked decrease in basal levels of apoptosis.
      Finally, we found that activated Cdc42 existed in cells in complex with
      phosphoionositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), the downstream mediator of
      PI3-kinase action. The data indicate that Dbl signaling stimulate the
      formation of a novel survival complex, through which anti-apoptotic
      signals are generated and propagated.

TI  - Evaluation of approaches to generation of tissue-specific knock-in mice.
PG  - 28772-81
AB  - We explored three approaches to create tissue-specific knock-in mice by
      generating knock-in mice in which a substrate-docking site of the PDK1
      protein kinase was ablated in Cre-expressing tissues in a way that
      prevented activation of one of its substrates, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase
      (S6K), but not another (protein kinase B (PKB)). Employing two of the
      approaches, termed the "heterozygous" and "minigene" methods, we generated
      mice in which Cre-expressing skeletal and cardiac muscle produced the
      mutant rather than wild type PDK1. Consistent with this, injection of
      these mice with insulin only induced activation of PKB but not S6K in
      muscle tissues. We have also demonstrated that insulin-stimulated glucose
      uptake proceeds normally in knock-in mice, consistent with the notion that
      PKB mediates this process. In contrast to conditional knock-out of PDK1 in
      muscle, the knock-in mice did not develop dilated cardiomyopathy,
      suggesting that PKB plays a key role in protecting mice from heart
      failure. The third knock-in strategy that was evaluated, termed the
      "inversion" method, did not proceed with high efficiency. We discuss the
      merits and disadvantages of each of the conditional knock-in approaches,
      along with the applications for which they may be most suited, and suggest
      how they could be further refined.

TI  - Altered caveolin-3 expression disrupts PI(3) kinase signaling leading to
      death of cultured muscle cells.
PG  - 2816-25
AB  - Caveolae and their coat proteins, caveolins, co-ordinate multiple
      signaling pathways. Caveolin-3 is a muscle-specific caveolin isoform that
      is deficient in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1 C (LGMD1C).
      Paradoxically, overexpression of this protein also causes muscle
      degeneration in vivo. We hypothesize that altered membrane expression of
      caveolin-3 in muscle cells causes a degenerative phenotype by disrupting
      the co-ordination of signaling pathways that are critical to the
      maintenance of cell survival. Here, we show for the first time that, in
      normal muscle cells subjected to oxidative stress, the
      phosphatidylinositol (3) kinase (PI(3) kinase)-associated proteins PDK1
      and Akt associate with caveolae where they bind to caveolin-3, and that
      normal activation of this pathway promotes cell survival. Either increased
      or decreased expression of caveolin-3 at the membrane caused an increased
      susceptibility to oxidative stress, and myotube survival was markedly
      improved by PI(3) kinase inhibition. This occurred concomitantly with
      altered phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic proteins GSK3beta and Bad,
      despite normal levels of Akt activation. Taken together, our results
      demonstrate that altered caveolin-3 expression can change the outcome of
      PI(3) kinase activation from cell survival to cell death. These findings
      indicate that normal expression and localization of caveolin-3 are
      required to appropriately co-ordinate PI(3) kinase/Akt-mediated cell
      survival signaling, and suggest that this pathway may be an effective
      therapeutic target for the treatment of muscular dystrophies associated
      with caveolin-3 mutations.

TI  - Role of the Phox homology domain and phosphorylation in activation of
      serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-3.
PG  - 23978-89
AB  - Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinases (SGKs) form a family of
      serine/threonine protein kinases that exhibit structural and sequence
      similarity to the protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt family. The major difference
      between these two families is the absence of a lipid-binding, pleckstrin
      homology domain in the SGKs. Despite the absence of the pleckstrin
      homology domain, activation of the three human isoforms is, like PKB,
      dependent upon the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) pathway that is
      induced by growth factors and mitogens. Full-length SGK3 contains a
      complete Phox homology (PX) domain that targets the protein to endosomes.
      Both a functional PX domain and PI3K activation are necessary for
      phosphorylation of SGK3 at two regulatory sites (Thr-320 and Ser-486) and
      subsequent induction of kinase activity. PDK1 phosphorylates
      endosome-associated SGK3 at Thr-320, whereas diversion of SGK3 to the
      plasma membrane, where PDK1 normally activates PKB, interferes with PDK1
      phosphorylation of SGK3. A chimeric protein in which the carboxyl-terminal
      hydrophobic motif (HM) of SGK3 has been exchanged for the HM of PRK2 is
      constitutively active. Finally, we demonstrate that SGK3 activation
      becomes PX domain-independent once the HM is phosphorylated. Taken
      together, these data indicate that the targeting of SGK3 to endosomes,
      mediated by its PX domain, is essential for proper SGK3 activation, likely
      due to co-localization of SGK3 with an endosomal, PI3K-dependent and
      staurosporine-sensitive HM kinase.

TI  - Troglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist,
      decreases tau phosphorylation in CHOtau4R cells.
PG  - 1068-77
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a member of
      the nuclear receptor superfamily, is activated by several compounds
      including the thiazolidinediones. In addition to being a target for
      diabetes, PPARgamma activation state has recently been shown to modulate
      beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) production in cellular models relevant to
      Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report the effect of troglitazone, a
      thiazolidinedione, in cells expressing 4-repeat tau. A 24 h treatment with
      troglitazone significantly reduced phosphorylation of tau at Ser202 and
      Ser396/404, residues of early and later stages of neurofibrillary tangle
      accumulation in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.
      Under the same experimental conditions the level of tau did not change. In
      our cellular model, troglitazone appeared to enhance
      3'-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) nuclear
      translocation, resulting in a decrease in cytosolic phosphorylated 70 kDa
      ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6) and phosphorylated mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTor). Furthermore, PPARgamma transcriptional activity did not
      appear to be responsible for decreased phosphorylation of tau. Thus, we
      believe that the thiazolidinedione regulates tau phosphorylation through a
      PPARgamma-dependent/independent mechanism involving an Akt/glycogen
      synthase kinase-3(GSK-3beta)-independent signalling cascade:
      PDK1/p70S6K/mTor.

TI  - Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 targets protein kinase A in a pathway
      that regulates interleukin 4.
PG  - 1733-44
AB  - CD28 plays a critical role in T cell immune responses. Although the kinase
      Akt has been shown to act downstream of CD28 in T helper (Th)1 cytokine
      induction, it does not induce Th2 cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4).
      We recently reported that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)
      partially corrects the defect in IL-4 production present in CD28-deficient
      T cells, suggesting that PDK1 regulates IL-4 independently of Akt. We now
      describe a signaling pathway in which PDK1 targets IL-4 in the murine Th2
      cell line D10. PDK1-mediated activation of this pathway is dependent on
      protein kinase A (PKA) and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
      P1 transcriptional element in the IL-4 promoter. PDK1 localizes to the
      immune synapse in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner,
      partially colocalizes with PKA at the synapse, and physically interacts
      with PKA. In RNA interference knockdown experiments, PDK1 is necessary for
      phosphorylation of PKA in T cells, as well as for activation of the IL-4
      NFAT P1 element by the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. Phosphorylation of
      the critical PKA threonine residue is stimulated by engagement of TCR/CD28
      via a PDK1-dependent mechanism. These findings together define a pathway
      linking the kinases PDK1 and PKA in the induction of the Th2 cytokine
      IL-4.

TI  - Differential roles of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and akt1
      expression and phosphorylation in breast cancer cell resistance to
      Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin, and gemcitabine.
PG  - 1045-52
AB  - 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and Akt1 are two
      closely related components of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
      pathway, which is aberrantly regulated in breast cancer. Despite the
      importance of PDK1, few studies have evaluated it as a potential target
      for cancer therapy compared with studies of Akt1. We hypothesized that
      PDK1 is a superior target in the PI3K pathway. To test this, we first used
      a mouse mammary cell line retrovirally infected to express human PDK1 or
      Akt1 for comparative studies of treatment with paclitaxel, doxorubicin,
      and gemcitabine. Overexpression of PDK1 or Akt1 conferred similar
      resistance to treatment with paclitaxel or doxorubicin compared with
      control cells. However, the PDK1-overexpressing cells were more resistant
      to gemcitabine than were the Akt1-overexpressing cells. We next correlated
      the expression and activation-specific phosphorylation of PDK1 and Akt1
      with the cytotoxic effects of the same agents in several human breast
      cancer cell lines. Cells with high levels of phosphorylated PDK1 were more
      resistant to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis than cells expressing high
      levels of phosphorylated Akt1. To further validate this observation, we
      used small interfering RNA oligonucleotides to selectively knock down PDK1
      or Akt1 expression in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. We found that
      knockdown of PDK1 expression sensitized MCF7 cells to gemcitabine-induced
      apoptosis more effectively than did knockdown of Akt1 expression in the
      same cells. Our findings show that PDK1 may be a superior alternative to
      Akt1 as a target for sensitizing breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
      agents, particularly gemcitabine.

TI  - Mahanine inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells
      through the deactivation of Akt and activation of caspases.
PG  - 1257-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study was undertaken to evaluate
      anti-proliferative and -apoptotic activities of mahanine, a plant derived
      carbazole alkaloid, in prostate cancer cells and to determine its
      molecular mechanism by which it induces apoptotic cell death. METHODS: The
      growth inhibitory and apoptotic inductive effect of mahanine on prostate
      cancer cells were examined by measuring cell proliferation and BrdU
      labeling, caspase activity, DNA fragmentation, and Western blot analyses.
      RESULTS: Mahanine inhibited growth of PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells
      in a dose and time-dependent manner. Mechanistically, mahanine inhibited
      cell-survival pathway by dephosphorylation of PIP3 dependent kinase 1
      (PDK1) thereby deactivation of Akt and downregulation of Bcl-xL. In
      addition, mahanine activated caspase pathway (caspases 9 and 3) and
      eventually cleavage of DNA repair enzyme, PARP resulting DNA fragmentation
      and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Mahanine inhibits growth and induces apoptosis
      in both androgen-responsive, LNCaP and androgen-independent, PC3 cells by
      targeting cell survival pathway.

TI  - Phosphoproteome profiling of human skin fibroblast cells in response to
      low- and high-dose irradiation.
PG  - 1252-60
AB  - A hallmark of the response to high-dose radiation is the up-regulation and
      phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA
      damage signaling, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Exposure of cells to low
      doses of radiation has well documented biological effects, but the
      underlying regulatory mechanisms are still poorly understood. The
      objective of this study is to provide an initial profile of the normal
      human skin fibroblast (HSF) phosphoproteome and explore potential
      differences between low- and high-dose irradiation responses at the
      protein phosphorylation level. Several techniques including Trizol
      extraction of proteins, methylation of tryptic peptides, enrichment of
      phosphopeptides with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC),
      nanoflow reversed-phase HPLC (nano-LC)/electrospray ionization, and tandem
      mass spectrometry were combined for analysis of the HSF cell
      phosphoproteome. Among 494 unique phosphopeptides, 232 were singly
      phosphorylated, while 262 peptides had multiple phosphorylation sites
      indicating the overall effectiveness of the IMAC technique to enrich both
      singly and multiply phosphorylated peptides. We observed approximately
      1.9-fold and approximately 3.6-fold increases in the number of identified
      phosphopeptides in low-dose and high-dose samples respectively, suggesting
      both radiation levels stimulate cell signaling pathways. A 6-fold increase
      in the phosphorylation of cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) motifs was
      observed after low- dose irradiation, while high-dose irradiation
      stimulated phosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase-1 (PDK1) and AKT/RSK motifs 8.5- and 5.5-fold, respectively. High-
      dose radiation resulted in the increased phosphorylation of proteins
      involved in cell signaling pathways as well as apoptosis while low-dose
      and control phosphoproteins were broadly distributed among biological
      processes.

TI  - Characterization of the TCL-1 transgenic mouse as a preclinical drug
      development tool for human chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 1334-8
AB  - Drug development in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been
      limited by lack of a suitable animal model to adequately assess
      pharmacologic properties relevant to clinical application. A recently
      described TCL-1 transgenic mouse develops a chronic B-cell CD5(+) leukemia
      that might be useful for such studies. Following confirmation of the
      natural history of this leukemia in the transgenic mice, we demonstrated
      that the transformed murine lymphocytes express relevant therapeutic
      targets (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, AKT, PDK1, and DNMT1), wild-type p53 status, and in
      vitro sensitivity to therapeutic agents relevant to the treatment of human
      CLL. We then demonstrated the in vivo clinical activity of low-dose
      fludarabine in transgenic TCL-1 mice with active leukemia. These studies
      demonstrated both early reduction in blood-lymphocyte count and spleen
      size and prolongation of survival (P = .046) compared with control mice.
      Similar to human CLL, an emergence of resistance was noted with
      fludarabine treatment in vivo. Overall, these studies suggest that the
      TCL-1 transgenic leukemia mouse model has similar clinical and therapeutic
      response properties to human CLL and may therefore serve as a useful in
      vivo tool to screen new drugs for subsequent development in CLL.

TI  - Receptor association and tyrosine phosphorylation of S6 kinases.
PG  - 2023-36
AB  - Ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is activated by an array of mitogenic
      stimuli and is a key player in the regulation of cell growth. The
      activation process of S6 kinase involves a complex and sequential series
      of multiple Ser/Thr phosphorylations and is mainly mediated via
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
      kinase-1 (PDK1) and mTor-dependent pathways. Upstream regulators of S6K,
      such as PDK1 and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), are recruited to the membrane
      via their pleckstrin homology (PH) or protein-protein interaction domains.
      However, the mechanism of integration of S6K into a multi-enzyme complex
      around activated receptor tyrosine kinases is not clear. In the present
      study, we describe a specific interaction between S6K with receptor
      tyrosine kinases, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).
      The interaction with PDGFR is mediated via the kinase or the kinase
      extension domain of S6K. Complex formation is inducible by growth factors
      and leads to S6K tyrosine phosphorylation. Using PDGFR mutants, we have
      shown that the phosphorylation is exerted via a PDGFR-src pathway.
      Furthermore, src kinase phosphorylates and coimmunoprecipitates with S6K
      in vivo. Inhibitors towards tyrosine kinases, such as genistein and PP1,
      or src-specific SU6656, but not PI3K and mTor inhibitors, lead to a
      reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of S6K. In addition, we mapped the
      sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in S6K1 and S6K2 to Y39 and Y45,
      respectively. Mutational and immunofluorescent analysis indicated that
      phosphorylation of S6Ks at these sites does not affect their activity or
      subcellular localization. Our data indicate that S6 kinase is recruited
      into a complex with RTKs and src and becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine/s
      in response to PDGF or serum.

TI  - Curcumin targets Akt cell survival signaling pathway in HTLV-I-infected
      T-cell lines.
PG  - 322-7
AB  - The Akt signaling pathway is important for survival and growth of cancer
      cells. In the present paper we show that the Akt signaling pathway is
      constitutively activated in human T-cell leukemia virus type I
      (HTLV-I)-infected T-cell lines and in primary adult T-cell leukemia (ATL)
      cells. Curcumin, a natural compound present in turmeric, has been studied
      vigorously as a potent chemopreventive agent for cancer therapy because of
      its inhibitory effect on proliferation and induction of apoptosis in
      several tumor cell lines. We investigated the effect of curcumin on Akt
      activity in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells.
      Phosphorylated PDK1 is an activator of Akt by phosphorylating Akt.
      Curcumin reduced phosphorylation of PDK1 and inhibited constitutive
      activation of Akt. Curcumin activated glycogen synthase kinase
      (GSK)-3beta, a downstream target of Akt kinase, by inhibiting
      phosphorylation of this protein. Curcumin reduced the expression of cell
      cycle regulators, cyclin D1 and c-Myc proteins, which are both degraded by
      activated GSK-3beta. Our results suggest that activation of the Akt
      signaling pathway plays an important role in ATL cell survival, and that
      curcumin may have anti-ATL properties mediated, at least in part, by
      inhibiting Akt activity. We propose that Akt-targeting agents could be
      useful for the treatment of ATL. In this regard, curcumin is a potentially
      promising compound for the treatment of ATL.

TI  - Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinases: variations on a theme.
PG  - 1391-407
AB  - The phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathway plays a
      critical role in a variety of cellular responses such as modulation of
      cell survival, glucose homeostasis, cell division, and cell growth. PI3K
      generates important lipid second messengers-phosphatidylinositides that
      are phosphorylated at the 3' position of their inositol ring head-group.
      These membrane restricted lipids act by binding with high affinity to
      specific protein domains such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.
      Effectors of PI3K include molecules that harbor such domains such as
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB), also
      termed Akt. The mammalian genome encodes three different PKB genes (alpha,
      beta, and gamma; Akt1, 2, and 3, respectively) and each is an attractive
      target for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as glioblastoma and
      breast cancer. A second family of three protein kinases, termed serum and
      glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinases (SGKs), is structurally related
      to the PKB family including regulation by PI3K but lack a PH domain.
      However, in addition to PH domains, a second class of 3' phosphorylated
      inositol phospholipid-binding domains exists that is termed Phox homology
      (PX) domain: this domain is found in one of the SGKs (SGK3). Here, we
      summarize knowledge of the three SGK isoforms and compare and contrast
      them to PKB with respect to their possible importance in cellular
      regulation and potential as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Simultaneous inhibition of PDK1/AKT and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3
      signaling by a small-molecule KP372-1 induces mitochondrial dysfunction
      and apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia.
PG  - 3737-46
AB  - Phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and Fms-like
      tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) signaling are aberrantly activated in acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. Constitutively activated AKT and FLT3
      regulate leukemia cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. In this
      study, we investigated the effects of the novel multiple kinase inhibitor
      KP372-1 on the survival of AML cell lines and primary AML samples. KP372-1
      directly inhibited the kinase activity of AKT, PDK1, and FLT3 in a
      concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis indicated that
      KP372-1 decreased the phosphorylation of AKT on both Ser(473) and
      Thr(308); abrogated the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, BAD, and Foxo3a
      via PI3K/AKT signaling; and down-regulated expression of PIM-1 through
      direct inhibition of FLT3. Treatment of AML cell lines with KP372-1
      resulted in rapid generation of reactive oxygen species and stimulation of
      oxygen consumption, followed by mitochondrial depolarization, caspase
      activation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. KP372-1 induced
      pronounced apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary samples irrespective of
      their FLT3 status, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Moreover, KP372-1
      markedly decreased the colony-forming ability of primary AML samples
      (IC(50) < 200 nmol/L) with minimal cytotoxic effects on normal progenitor
      cells. Taken together, our results show that the simultaneous inhibition
      of critical prosurvival kinases by KP372-1 leads to mitochondrial
      dysfunction and apoptosis of AML but not normal hematopoietic progenitor
      cells.

TI  - Delineating the mechanism by which selenium deactivates Akt in prostate
      cancer cells.
PG  - 246-52
AB  - The up-regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
      is prevalent in many cancers. This phenomenon makes PI3K and Akt fruitful
      targets for cancer therapy and/or prevention because they are mediators of
      cell survival signaling. Although the suppression of phospho-Akt by
      selenium has been reported previously, little information is available on
      whether selenium modulates primarily the PI3K-phosphoinositide-dependent
      kinase 1 (PDK1) side of Akt phosphorylation or the phosphatase side of Akt
      dephosphorylation. The present study was aimed at addressing these
      questions in PC-3 prostate cancer cells which are phosphatase and tensin
      homologue-null. Our results showed that selenium decreased Akt
      phosphorylation at Thr308 (by PDK1) and Ser473 (by an unidentified
      kinase); the Thr308 site was more sensitive to selenium inhibition than
      the Ser473 site. The protein levels of PI3K and phospho-PDK1 were not
      affected by selenium. However, the activity of PI3K was reduced by 30% in
      selenium-treated cells, thus discouraging the recruitment of PDK1 and Akt
      to the membrane due to low phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
      formation by PI3K. Consistent with the above interpretation, the membrane
      localization of PDK1 and Akt was significantly diminished as shown by
      Western blotting. In the presence of a calcium chelator or a specific
      inhibitor of calcineurin (a calcium-dependent phosphatase), the
      suppressive effect of selenium on phospho-Akt(Ser473) was greatly reduced.
      The finding suggests that selenium-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt via
      calcineurin is likely to be an additional mechanism in regulating the
      status of phospho-Akt.

TI  - Cytotoxicity of a non-cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory derivative of celecoxib
      in non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells.
PG  - 117-24
AB  - Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death worldwide.
      Although recent advances in chemotherapy and radiation therapy have
      yielded modest improvements in patient outcomes, overall survival remains
      poor. Therefore, new therapeutic targets are needed.
      Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is one potential target. The
      aim of the present studies was to investigate the potential of a
      celecoxib-derived PDK1 inhibitor (OSU03013), that does not inhibit
      cyclooxygenase-2, to kill lung cancer cells in vitro. Using human
      non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells, OSU03013 dose-dependently induced
      apoptosis. After 6 h of treatment with 7.5 microM OSU03013, 26% of the
      cells were apoptotic, compared to 4% of the control cells as determined by
      measuring the sub-G1 peak of propidium iodide stained cells with flow
      cytometry. A similar increase in apoptosis was evident using the Cell
      Death ELISA assay. OSU03013-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a
      reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of
      cytochrome c and the cleavage of caspase-3. Surprisingly, the
      phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 was increased in A549 cells treated
      with 7.5 microM OSU03013. However, the toxicity of OSU03013 was reduced in
      A549 cells expressing a constitutively active form of Akt. These data
      demonstrate that OSU03013 induces apoptosis in A549 cells via the
      mitochondrial pathway. Inhibition of the Akt pathway appears uninvolved in
      this toxicity, although Akt can provide protection. These results also
      suggest the potential of celecoxib-derived agents to treat some forms of
      lung cancer.

TI  - Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, mediates its antiproliferative action
      in pituitary tumor cells by altering phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      signaling and inducing Zac1 expression.
PG  - 1576-82
AB  - Somatostatin limits cell growth by inhibiting the proliferative activity
      of growth factor receptors. In this study, it is shown that in pituitary
      tumor cells, the somatostatin analogue octreotide produces its
      antiproliferative action by inducing the expression the tumor suppressor
      gene Zac1. ZAC/Zac1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and is highly
      expressed in normal pituitary, mammary, and ovarian glands but is
      down-regulated in pituitary, breast, and ovarian tumors. Knocking down
      Zac1 by RNA interference abolished the antiproliferative effect of
      octreotide in pituitary tumor cells, indicating that Zac1 is necessary for
      the action of octreotide. The effect of octreotide on Zac1 expression was
      pertussis toxin sensitive and was abolished after transfection with a
      dominant negative vector for SHP-1. Zac1 is a target of the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) survival pathway. Octreotide
      treatment decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the PI3K
      regulatory subunit p85, induced dephosphorylation of
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt, and activated glycogen
      synthase kinase 3beta (GSKbeta). Therefore, in pituitary tumor cells,
      somatostatin analogues produce their antiproliferative action by acting on
      the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and increasing Zac1 gene expression.

TI  - Adi3 is a Pdk1-interacting AGC kinase that negatively regulates plant cell
      death.
PG  - 255-65
AB  - Bacterial speck disease in tomato is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv.
      tomato. Resistance to this disease is conferred by the host Pto kinase,
      which recognizes P. s. pv. tomato strains that express the effector
      AvrPto. We report here that an AvrPto-dependent Pto-interacting protein 3
      (Adi3) is a member of the AGC family of protein kinases. In mammals, AGC
      kinases are regulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1
      (Pdk1). We characterized tomato Pdk1 and showed that Pdk1 and Pto
      phosphorylate Adi3. Gene silencing of Adi3 in tomato causes
      MAPKKKalpha-dependent formation of necrotic lesions. Use of a chemical
      inhibitor of Pdk1, OSU-03012, also implicates Pdk1 and Adi3 in plant cell
      death regulation. Adi3 thus appears to function analogously to the
      mammalian AGC kinase protein kinase B/Akt by negatively regulating cell
      death via Pdk1 phosphorylation. We speculate that the negative regulatory
      function of Adi3 might be subverted by interaction with Pto/AvrPto,
      leading to host cell death that is associated with pathogen attack.

TI  - Human cytomegalovirus inhibits Akt-mediated eNOS activation through
      upregulating PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
      10).
PG  - 502-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the United
      States, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection may play a role in the
      development of this disease. Diminished expression and/or activity of
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are an early event in
      atherogenesis. In the current study, we investigated the effects of HCMV
      infection on eNOS activation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs).
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that HCMV inhibited eNOS
      phosphorylation/activation in HAECs. The signaling upstream of eNOS
      involving Akt and PDK1 were also suppressed by the HCMV infection.
      Moreover, HCMV infection increased the expression of PTEN (phosphatase and
      tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10). Silencing PTEN expression with
      specific siRNA reversed the inhibitory effects on eNOS activation in
      HCMV-infected cells indicating the involvement of PTEN in mediating HCMV's
      inhibitory effects. Next we observed that the activation of p38 MAPK
      stress signaling pathway mediates HCMV's effects on PTEN up-regulation and
      eNOS inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our findings suggest that
      inhibition of eNOS leading to endothelial dysfunction may be a basis of
      the pro-atherogenic effects of HCMV. Importantly, upregulation of PTEN and
      activation of stress signal p38 MAPK are involved in HCMV's inhibitory
      effects on eNOS activation.

TI  - Class reunion: PTEN joins the nuclear crew.
PG  - 7394-400
AB  - Several recent reports have brought conclusive evidence that the tumor
      suppressor PTEN, once considered a strictly cytoplasmic protein, shuttles
      to the nuclear compartment, where it joins a variety of components of the
      same pathway it regulates in the cytoplasm, among which PI3K, PDK1 and
      AKT. In this review, we focus on the growing supporting evidence for an
      important physiological role of this nuclear pathway and on the role that
      alteration of this novel regulatory circuit may play during cell
      transformation.

TI  - Hypomorphic mutation of PDK1 suppresses tumorigenesis in PTEN(+/-) mice.
PG  - 1839-46
AB  - Many cancers possess elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), the second
      messenger that induces activation of the protein kinases PKB/Akt and S6K
      and thereby stimulates cell proliferation, growth, and survival. The
      importance of this pathway in tumorigenesis has been highlighted by the
      finding that PTEN, the lipid phosphatase that breaks down
      PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) to PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is frequently mutated in human
      cancer. Cells lacking PTEN possess elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3),
      PKB, and S6K activity and heterozygous PTEN(+/-) mice develop a variety of
      tumors. Knockout of PKBalpha in PTEN-deficient cells reduces aggressive
      growth and promotes apoptosis, whereas treatment of PTEN(+/-) mice with
      rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of S6K, reduces neoplasia. We
      explored the importance of PDK1, the protein kinase that activates PKB and
      S6K, in mediating tumorigenesis caused by the deletion of PTEN. We
      demonstrate that reducing the expression of PDK1 in PTEN(+/-) mice,
      markedly protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors.
      Our findings provide genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in
      mediating neoplasia resulting from loss of PTEN and also validate PDK1 as
      a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors that possess
      elevated PKB and S6K activity.

PG  - 9794-806
AB  - Activation of the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) kinase pathway can be
      neuroprotective after stroke. Akt is activated by growth factors via a
      phosphorylation-dependent pathway involving the kinases phosphoinositide 3
      (PI3) kinase and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and is
      negatively regulated by phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on

      degrees C) reduced infarct size and improved functional outcomes up to 2
      months. Changes in phosphorylation levels of Akt, as measured by Western
      blots and immunostaining, differed from levels of Akt activity measured in
      an in vitro assay in normothermic animals. Hypothermia blocked most of
      these changes and maintained Akt activity. Inhibition of PI3/Akt enlarged
      infarct size in hypothermic animals. Hypothermia improved phosphorylation
      of PDK1, PTEN, and FKHR. Hypothermia did not improve GSK3beta (Ser9)
      phosphorylation but blocked the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated
      beta-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) downstream of GSK3beta. Phosphorylation
      levels of PTEN, Akt, and Akt substrate decreased before apoptotic
      cytochrome c release and degradation of microtubule-associated protein-2,
      a marker of neuronal survival. Hypothermia may protect from ischemic
      damage in part by preserving Akt activity and attenuating the apoptotic
      effects of PTEN, PDK1, and FKHR.

TI  - In vivo role of the phosphate groove of PDK1 defined by knockin mutation.
PG  - 5023-34
AB  - AGC kinases are mediators of signalling responses stimulated by agonists
      and are activated following phosphorylation at their T-loop residue by the
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Agonists stimulate
      the activation of the AGC kinases p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), p90
      ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein
      kinase (SGK), by inducing the phosphorylation of these enzymes at a
      non-catalytic regulatory site termed the hydrophobic motif. This creates a
      high-affinity docking site enabling PDK1 to bind and phosphorylate the
      T-loop of these enzymes. The site that interacts with these substrates is
      located on the small lobe of the catalytic domain of PDK1 and is composed
      of a hydrophobic groove next to a basic phosphate groove. The disruption
      of the hydrophobic groove ablates activation of S6K, RSK and SGK, but the
      role of the phosphate groove in regulating the function of PDK1 has not
      been explored in vivo. We generated knockin ES cells, in which both copies
      of the gene encoding PDK1 were altered to express a form of PDK1 that
      retains catalytic activity and integrity of the hydrophobic groove, but in
      which the phosphate groove was disrupted. The knockin ES cells were
      viable, mutant PDK1 was expressed at normal levels and IGF1 induced
      activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which is a PDK1 substrate that
      does not require hydrophobic motif phosphorylation to be activated. In the
      phosphate-groove-knockin ES cells, the activation of S6K, RSK and SGK by
      agonists, although markedly impaired, was not abolished. PDK1 also
      phosphorylates the T-loop of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, which
      stabilizes these enzymes. However, in contrast to S6K, RSK and SGK,
      hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of these enzymes is not thought to
      control their activation by PDK1. Consistent with this notion, we employed
      appropriate PDK1-knockin ES cells to demonstrate that the hydrophobic
      groove of PDK1, but not the phosphate groove, is required for the
      stabilization of PKC isoforms. These findings provide genetic evidence
      that the phosphate groove of PDK1 is required for maximal activation of
      isoforms of S6K, SGK and RSK, but not PKC. We also found that no live
      births of homozygous phosphate-groove-knockin mice are observed,
      indicating a key role for this regulatory motif in normal development. The
      knockin embryos develop to a greater extent than PDK1-knockout and
      hydrophobic-groove-knockin embryos, which died between E9.5-E11.5. The
      knockin embryos are observed until E19.5 and displayed general growth
      retardation and craniofacial developmental defects.

TI  - A small molecule compound inhibits AKT pathway in ovarian cancer cell
      lines.
PG  - 308-17
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Overactivation of AKT1 and gene amplification of
      AKT2 are frequently detected in ovarian cancer. Activated AKT kinases
      provide a cell survival signal that may confer resistance to apoptosis
      induced by conventional therapies in cancer cells. Therefore, development
      of potent inhibitors that block AKT pathway is an attractive therapeutic
      strategy for treating ovarian carcinoma. METHODS: Ovarian cancer cell
      lines, A2780, MDAH2774, OVCAR-8, Caov-3, and normal murine fibroblasts
      (NIH3T3) were used. Cells were treated with different doses of a
      non-peptide small molecule compound, 9-methoxy-2-methylellipticinium
      acetate (termed API-59-OME) that potentially inhibit AKT pathway. Kinase
      assays and the phosphorylation of AKT, GSK-3alpha/beta, PDK1, ERK1/2, SGK,
      p38, FAK, EGFR, JAK2, PKC isoforms, and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose)
      polymerase (PARP) were examined in treated and untreated cell lines.
      Further, cells treated with API-59-OME were analyzed for induction of
      apoptosis using sub-G1 profile with propidium iodide staining. RESULTS:
      API-59-OME inhibited AKT kinase activity but did not inhibit ERK or JNK
      kinase activities in A2780, MDAH2774, and OVCAR-8 cell lines. API-59-OME
      did not reduce phosphorylation of other protein kinases in these cell
      lines. API-59-OME induced apoptosis and the cleavage of PARP in A2780,
      MDAH2774, and OVCAR-8 ovarian cancer cell lines that express elevated
      levels of phosphorylated AKT. In contrast, in Caov-3 and NIH3T3 cell
      lines, which lack constitutive AKT activity, API-59-OME only had minimal
      effect to induce apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that API-59-OME
      may be a potent agent to target constitutively activated AKT pathway in
      ovarian cancer cells.

      (IkkB) phosphorylation activates NF-kappaB signaling.
PG  - 40965-73
AB  - The IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB and phosphatidylinositol
      3-OH-kinase/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)/Akt
      pathways regulate various cellular functions, especially cell survival.
      These two pathways are often activated in many tumors and are thought to
      be associated with tumor progression. However, the cross-talk between them
      remains unclear. Here we show that PDK1 can activate IKK/NF-kappaB
      signaling in addition to Akt signaling to promote cell survival. Screening
      kinases that could modulate NF-kappaB activity revealed that expression of
      an upstream Akt kinase PDK1 up-regulates NF-kappaB transcriptional
      activity. We found that PDK1 directly phosphorylates IKKbeta at the
      Ser(181) residue in the activation loop, leading to NF-kappaB nuclear
      translocation and NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic gene expression.
      IKKalpha is not required for PDK1-mediated NF-kappaB activation because
      NF-kappaB activation was observed in IKKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic
      fibroblast (MEF) cells as in wild type MEF cells. Akt, which was
      previously reported to activate IKKalpha, did not participate in the
      PDK1-dependent IKKbeta or NF-kappaB activation. The siRNA-mediated PDK1
      gene silencing attenuated NF-kappaB activity and increased TRAIL-mediated
      cytotoxicity. Moreover, expression of constitutively active IKKbeta
      overcame the PDK1 siRNA-mediated susceptibility to TRAIL. These results
      indicate that PDK1 is a critical regulator of cell survival by modulating
      the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway in addition to the Akt pathway.

PG  - 1157-62
AB  - Activation of cytosolic phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K) signaling
      pathway has been well established to regulate gene expression, cell cycle,
      and survival by feeding signals to the nucleus. In addition, strong
      evidences accumulated over the past few years indicate the presence of an
      autonomous inositol lipid metabolism and PI-3K signaling within the
      nucleus. Much less, however, is known about the role and regulation of
      this nuclear PI-3K pathway. Components of the PI-3K signaling pathway,
      including PI 3-kinase and its downstream kinase Akt, have been identified
      at the nuclear level. Consistent with the presence of a complete PI-3K
      signaling pathway in the nucleus, we have recently found that
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), a kinase functioning
      downstream of PI-3K and upstream of Akt, is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling
      protein. In the present review, we update our current knowledge on the
      regulatory mechanisms and the functional roles of PDK1 nuclear
      translocation. We also summarize some of the kinase-independent activities
      of PDK1 in cell signaling.

TI  - ICAM-3-induced cancer cell proliferation through the PI3K/Akt pathway.
PG  - 103-10
AB  - ICAM-3 interacts with LFA1, and is involved in the intercellular adhesion
      of leukocytes as well as in the mainenance of cell survival. It has also
      been suggested to induce cancer cell proliferation but the precise
      signaling pathway is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the
      ICAM-3-activated downstream pathway in H1299 lung cancer cells. The level
      of ICAM-3-induced cell growth was examined using BrdU incorporation, which
      is a colony-forming assay, FACS analysis, and cell counting. The results
      showed that ICAM-3 expression induces cancer cell proliferation. In
      addition, FAK, Akt, PDK1, GSK-3beta, BAD, and PTEN were phosphorylated by
      ICAM-3-overexpression, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation. In
      conclusion, ICAM-3 expression induces cancer cell proliferation, and an
      increase in ICAM-3 expression can contribute to cancer progression.

TI  - Improved yields for baculovirus-mediated expression of human His(6)-PDK1
      and His(6)-PKBbeta/Akt2 and characterization of phospho-specific isoforms
      for design of inhibitors that stabilize inactive conformations.
PG  - 44-56
AB  - PDK1 and PKB/Akt have a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the C-terminus
      and N-terminus, respectively, which stabilizes an unphosphorylated,
      autoinhibited conformation. Binding of the PH domain to a phospholipid
      second messenger causes relief of autoinhibition, which results in kinase
      phosphorylation and activation. Baculovirus-mediated expression in Sf9
      insect cells of both His(6)-PDK1 and His(6)-PKBbeta/Akt2 were optimized,
      which significantly improved the yields (5-fold) of the affinity purified
      enzymes over previously reported values. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and
      Western analyses indicated that the apparent V(max)=192+/-13 U/mg and K(m)
      (PDK-Tide)=55+/-10 microM of purified His(6)-PDK1 results from a mixture
      of at least three different phospho-specific isoforms (pI values of 6.8,
      6.5, and 6.4). A purely unphosphorylated isoform of His(6)-PDK1 (pI=6.8)
      was generated by treatment with lambda protein phosphatase (lambdaPP),
      which decreased V(max) to 2.4+/-0.4 U/mg and increased K(m) (PDK-Tide) to
      217+/-61 microM. Isoelectric focusing and Western analyses indicated that
      the apparent V(max)=0.21+/-0.03 U/mg and K(m) (Crosstide)=87+/-30 microM
      of purified His(6)-PKBbeta/Akt2 results from a mixture of the enzyme
      monophosphorylated either at Ser-474 ( approximately 90%) or at Thr-309 (
      approximately 10%). A purely unphosphorylated isoform of
      His(6)-PKBbeta/Akt2 (pI=6.4) was generated by treatment with lambdaPP,
      which decreased V(max) approximately 2-fold. The optimization of
      high-level production and detailed characterization of purified and
      lambdaPP-treated His(6)-PDK1 and His(6)-PKBbeta/Akt2 will facilitate
      detailed structural and kinetic studies aimed at understanding the
      mechanism of second messenger-induced activation.

TI  - Identification of N10-substituted phenoxazines as potent and specific
      inhibitors of Akt signaling.
PG  - 31924-35
AB  - A series of 30 N10-substituted phenoxazines were synthesized and screened
      as potential inhibitors of Akt. In cellular assays at 5 mum, 17 compounds
      inhibited insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I)-stimulated phosphorylation
      of Akt (Ser-473) by at least 50% but did not inhibit IGF-I-stimulated
      phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204). Substitutions at the
      2-position (Cl or CF3) did not alter inhibitory activity, whereas
      N10-substitutions with derivatives having acetyl (20B) or morpholino (12B)
      side chain lost activity compared with propyl or butyl substituents (7B
      and 14B). Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was associated with the
      inhibition of IGF-I stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin
      phosphorylation (Ser-2448 and Ser-2481), phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase
      (Thr-389), and ribosomal protein S6 (Ser-235/236) in Rh1, Rh18, and Rh30
      cell lines. The two most potent compounds
      10-[4'-(N-diethylamino)butyl]-2-chlorophenoxazine (10B) and
      10-[4'-[(beta-hydroxyethyl)piperazino]butyl]-2-chlorophenoxazine (15B) (in
      vitro, IC50 approximately 1-2 microM) were studied further. Inhibition of
      Akt phosphorylation correlated with inhibition of its kinase activity as
      determined in vitro after immunoprecipitation. Akt inhibitory phenoxazines
      did not inhibit the activity of recombinant phosphatidylinositol
      3'-kinase, PDK1, or SGK1 but potently inhibited the kinase activity of
      recombinant Akt and Akt deltaPH, a mutant lacking the pleckstrin homology
      domain. Akt inhibitory phenoxazines blocked IGF-I-stimulated nuclear
      translocation of Akt in Rh1 cells and suppressed growth of Rh1, Rh18, and
      Rh30 cells (IC50 2-5 microM), whereas "inactive" derivatives were > or =
      10-fold less potent inhibitors of cell growth. In contrast to rapamycin
      analogs, Akt inhibitory phenoxazines induced significant levels of
      apoptosis under serum-containing culture conditions at concentrations of
      agent consistent with Akt inhibition. Thus, the cellular responses to
      phenoxazine inhibitors of Akt appear qualitatively different from the
      rapamycin analogs. Modeling studies suggest inhibitory phenoxazines may
      bind in the ATP-binding site, although ATP competition studies were unable
      to distinguish between competitive and noncompetitive inhibition.

      by insulin-like growth factor-1 via MAP kinases and hypoxia-inducible
      factor-1 in HepG2 cells.
PG  - 1176-84
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
      (PAI-1) appear to play a crucial role in a number of processes associated
      with growth and tissue remodelling. IGF-1 was shown to enhance PAI-1
      expression in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 hepatoma cells, but the
      molecular mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully
      elucidated. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional mechanism
      and the signaling pathway by which IGF-1 mediates induction of PAI-1
      expression in HepG2 cells. By using human PAI-1 promoter reporter gene
      assays we found that mutation of the hypoxia responsive element (HRE),
      which could bind hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), nearly abolished the
      induction by IGF-1. We found that IGF-1-induced up-regulation of PAI-1
      expression was associated with activation of HIF-1 alpha.
      Furthermore,IGF-1 enhanced HIF-1alpha protein levels and HIF-1 DNA-binding
      to each HRE,E4 and E5 as shown by EMSA. Mutation of the E-boxes, E4 and
      E5, did not affect the IGF-1-dependent induction of PAI-1 promoter
      constructs under normoxia but abolished the effect of IGF-1 under hypoxia.
      Inhibition of either the PI3K by LY294002 or ERK1/2 by U0126 reduced
      HIF-1alpha protein levels while both inhibitors together completely
      abolished the IGF-1 effect on HIF-1alpha. Remarkably, transfection of
      HepG2 cells with vectors expressing a dominant-negative PDK1 or the PKB
      inhibitor, TRB3, did not influence while dominant-negative Raf inhibited
      the IGF-1 effect on HIF-1alpha. Thus, IGF-1 activates human PAI-1 gene
      expression through activation of the PI3-kinase and ERK1/2 via HIF-1alpha.

TI  - Thrombin activates the p21-activated kinase in pulmonary artery smooth
      muscle cells. Role in tissue factor expression.
PG  - 1168-75
AB  - The p21-activated serine/threonine kinases (PAK) play an important role in
      a variety of cellular functions. However, their role in the smooth muscle
      response to thrombin, which is activated upon vascular injury and promotes
      vascular remodelling processes, is not resolved. Here we investigated the
      role of PAK in thrombin signalling and regulation of tissue factor (TF),
      the activator of the extrinsic coagulation cascade, in pulmonary artery
      smooth muscle cells (PASMC), the main cell type responsible for vascular
      remodelling in pulmonary hypertension. PAK was rapidly phosphorylated in
      response to thrombin. Thrombin and active PAKT423E phosphorylated p38 MAP
      kinase (p38MAPK), ERK1/2, phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)
      and protein kinase B/Akt (PKB) whereas kinase-deficient PAK1 prevented
      activation of these kinases by thrombin. In addition, kinase- deficient
      MKK3 inhibited activation of PDK1 and PKB by thrombin. Further, thrombin
      and active PAK1 induced TF expression and promoter activity while
      kinase-deficient PAK1 diminished thrombin-induced TF upregulation.
      Moreover, kinase-deficient MKK3, PDK1 and PKB inhibited thrombin- and
      PAK-dependent TF expression and promoter activity. Together these findings
      show that PAK is a critical element of thrombin signalling in PASMC which
      is involved in the regulation of TF expression by sequentially activating
      MKK3/p38MAPK, PDK1 and PKB. Thus, PAK may play an important role in
      promoting vascular remodelling processes in pulmonary hypertension.

TI  - Role of the PDK1-PKB-GSK3 pathway in regulating glycogen synthase and
      glucose uptake in the heart.
PG  - 3632-8
AB  - In order to investigate the importance of the PDK1-PKB-GSK3 signalling
      network in regulating glycogen synthase (GS) in the heart, we have
      employed tissue specific conditional knockout mice lacking PDK1 in muscle
      (mPDK1-/-), as well as knockin mice in which the protein kinase B (PKB)
      phosphorylation site on glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha (GSK3alpha)
      (Ser21) and GSK3beta (Ser9) is changed to Ala. We demonstrate that in
      hearts from mPDK1-/- or double GSK3alpha/GSK3beta knockin mice, insulin
      failed to stimulate the activity of GS or induce its dephosphorylation at
      residues that are phosphorylated by GSK3. We also establish that in the
      heart, both GSK3 isoforms participate in the regulation of GS, with
      GSK3beta playing a more prominent role. This contrasts with skeletal
      muscle where GSK3beta is the major regulator of insulin-induced GS
      activity. Despite the inability of insulin to stimulate glycogen synthesis
      in hearts from the mPDK1-/- or double GSK3alpha/GSK3beta knockin mice,
      these animals possessed normal levels of cardiac glycogen, demonstrating
      that total glycogen levels are regulated independently of insulin's
      ability to stimulate GS in the heart and that mechanisms such as
      allosteric activation of GS by glucose-6-phosphate and/or activation of GS
      by muscle contraction, could operate to maintain normal glycogen levels in
      these mice. We also demonstrate that in cardiomyocytes derived from the
      mPDK1-/- hearts, although the levels of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4)
      are increased 2-fold, insulin failed to stimulate glucose uptake,
      providing genetic evidence that PDK1 plays a crucial role in enabling
      insulin to promote glucose uptake in cardiac muscle.

TI  - Reconstitution of the mammalian PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway in yeast.
PG  - 613-23
AB  - The mammalian signalling pathway involving class I PI3K (phosphoinositide
      3-kinase), PTEN (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase) and PKB (protein
      kinase B)/c-Akt has roles in multiple processes, including cell
      proliferation and apoptosis. To facilitate novel approaches for genetic,
      molecular and pharmacological analyses of these proteins, we have
      reconstituted this signalling pathway by heterologous expression in the
      unicellular eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). High-level
      expression of the p110 catalytic subunit of mammalian PI3K dramatically
      inhibits yeast cell growth. This effect depends on PI3K kinase activity
      and is reversed partially by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and reversed
      fully by co-expression of catalytically active PTEN (but not its purported
      yeast orthologue, Tep1). Growth arrest by PI3K correlates with loss of
      PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and its conversion into PIP3
      (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate). PIP2 depletion causes severe
      rearrangements of actin and septin architecture, defects in secretion and
      endocytosis, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Slt2.
      In yeast producing PIP3, PKB/c-Akt localizes to the plasma membrane and
      its phosphorylation is enhanced. Phospho-specific antibodies show that
      both active and kinase-dead PKB/c-Akt are phosphorylated at Thr308 and
      Ser473. Thr308 phosphorylation, but not Ser473 phosphorylation, requires
      the yeast orthologues of mammalian PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent
      protein kinase-1): Pkh1 and Pkh2. Elimination of yeast Tor1 and Tor2
      function, or of the related kinases (Tel1, Mec1 and Tra1), did not block
      Ser473 phosphorylation, implicating another kinase(s). Reconstruction of
      the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway in yeast permits incisive study of these enzymes
      and analysis of their functional interactions in a simplified context,
      establishes a new tool to screen for novel agonists and antagonists and
      provides a method to deplete PIP2 uniquely in the yeast cell.

TI  - Identification of calcium-regulated heat-stable protein of 24 kDa
      (CRHSP24) as a physiological substrate for PKB and RSK using KESTREL.
PG  - 775-83
AB  - A substrate for PKBalpha (protein kinase Balpha) was detected in liver
      extracts, and was purified and identified as CRHSP24 (calcium-regulated
      heat-stable protein of apparent molecular mass 24 kDa). PKBalpha, as well
      as SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1) and RSK (p90
      ribosomal S6 kinase), phosphorylated CRHSP24 stoichiometrically at Ser52
      in vitro and its brain-specific isoform PIPPin at the equivalent residue
      (Ser58). CRHSP24 became phosphorylated at Ser52 when HEK-293 (human
      embryonic kidney) cells were stimulated with IGF-1 (insulin-like growth
      factor-1) and this was prevented by inhibitors of PI3K (phosphoinositide
      3-kinase), but not by rapamycin [an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of
      rapamycin)] or PD 184352, an inhibitor of the classical MAPK
      (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade and hence the activation of
      RSK. IGF-1 induced a similar phosphorylation of CRHSP24 in ES (embryonic
      stem) cells from wild-type mice or mice that express the PDK1
      (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) mutant (PDK1[L155E]) that
      activates PKBalpha normally, but cannot activate SGK. CRHSP24 also became
      phosphorylated at Ser52 in response to EGF (epidermal growth factor) and
      this was prevented by blocking activation of both the classical MAPK
      cascade and the activation of PKBalpha, but not if just one of these
      pathways was inhibited. DYRK2 (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated
      and -regulated protein kinase 2) phosphorylated CRHSP24 at Ser30, Ser32
      and Ser41 in vitro, and Ser41 was identified as a site phosphorylated in
      cells. These and other results demonstrate that CRHSP24 is phosphorylated
      at Ser52 by PKBalpha in response to IGF-1, at Ser52 by PKBalpha and RSK in
      response to EGF, and at Ser41 in the absence of IGF-1/EGF by a DYRK
      isoform or another proline-directed protein kinase(s).

      cells.
PG  - 525-35
AB  - Characteristics of hVSMC apoptosis and its inhibition by insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1) remain unclear. Also unclear is whether a balance
      in hVSMCs exists whereby c-Jun N-terminal stress kinases (JNK) promote
      apoptosis while extracellular signal-regulated (ERK1/2) MAP kinases
      inhibit cell death. In this study, we examined the involvement of Akt/PKB
      and its upstream kinase, PDK1 and whether JNK activation correlated with
      human and rat VSMC apoptosis induced by staurosporine and by c-myc,
      respectively. We observed a strong, sustained JNK activation (and c-Jun
      phosphorylation), which correlated with VSMC apoptosis. IGF-1 (13.3 nM),
      during apoptosis inhibition, transiently inhibited JNK activity at 1 h in
      a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)- and MEK-ERK-dependent manner, as
      wortmannin (100 nM) or PD98059 (30 muM) partially attenuated the IGF-1
      effect. PKC down-regulation had no effect on JNK inhibition by IGF-1.
      While IGF-1 alone produced a strong phosphorylation of Akt/PKB in hVSMCs
      up to 6 h, it was notably stronger and more sustained during ratmyc and
      hVSMCs apoptosis inhibition. Further, whereas transient expression of
      phosphorylated Akt protected VSMCs from apoptosis by nearly 50%,
      expression of dominant interfering alleles of Akt or PDK1 strongly
      inhibited IGF-1-mediated VSMC survival. These results demonstrate for the
      first time that transient inhibition of a pro-apoptotic stimulus in VSMCs
      may be sufficient to inhibit a programmed cell death and that sustained
      anti-apoptotic signals (Akt) elicited by IGF-1 are augmented during a
      death stimulus. Furthermore, PI3-K and ERK-MAPK pathways may cooperate to
      protect VSMCs from cell death.

TI  - Activation of a GST-tagged AKT2/PKBbeta.
PG  - 340-7
AB  - The protein kinase AKT is a key regulator for cell growth, cell survival
      and metabolic insulin action. However, the mechanism of activation of AKT
      in vivo, which presumably involves membrane recruitment of the kinase,
      oligomerization, and multiple phosphorylation events, is not fully
      understood. In the present study, we have expressed and purified dimeric
      GST-fusion proteins of human protein kinase AKT2 (DeltaPH-AKT2) in
      milligram quantities via the baculovirus expression system. Treatment of
      virus-infected insect cells with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid
      (OA) led to phosphorylation of the two regulatory phosphorylation sites,
      Thr309 and Ser474, and to activation of the kinase. Likewise,
      phosphorylation of Thr309 in vitro by recombinant PDK1 or mutation of
      Thr309 and Ser474 to acidic residues rendered the kinase constitutively
      active. However, even though the specific activity of our AKT2 was
      increased 15-fold compared to previous reports, GST-mediated dimerization
      alone did not lead to an activation of the kinase. Whereas both
      mutagenesis and phosphorylation led to an increase in the turnover number
      of the enzyme, only the latter resulted in a marked reduction (20-fold) of
      the apparent Km value for the exogenous substrate Crosstide, indicating
      that this widely used mutagenesis only partially mimics phosphorylation.
      Kinetic analysis of GST-AKT2 demonstrates that phosphorylation of Thr309
      in the activation loop of the kinase is largely responsible for the
      observed reduction in Km and for a subsequent 150-fold increase in the
      catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/Km) of the enzyme. Highly active AKT2
      constructs were used in autophosphorylation reactions in vitro, where
      inactive AKT2 kinases served as substrates. As a matter of fact, we found
      evidence for a minor autophosphorylation activity of AKT2 but no
      significant autophosphorylation of any of the two regulatory sites, Thr309
      or Ser474.

TI  - The tRNA methylase METTL1 is phosphorylated and inactivated by PKB and RSK
      in vitro and in cells.
PG  - 1696-705
AB  - A substrate for protein kinase B (PKB)alpha in HeLa cell extracts was
      identified as methyltransferase-like protein-1 (METTL1), the orthologue of
      trm8, which catalyses the 7-methylguanosine modification of tRNA in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PKB and ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) both
      phosphorylated METTL1 at Ser27 in vitro. Ser27 became phosphorylated when
      HEK293 cells were stimulated with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and
      this was prevented by inhibition of phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase. The
      IGF-1-induced Ser27 phosphorylation did not occur in
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)-deficient embryonic
      stem cells, but occurred normally in PDK1[L155E] cells, indicating that
      the effect of IGF-1 is mediated by PKB. METTL1 also became phosphorylated
      at Ser27 in response to phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate and this was
      prevented by PD 184352 or pharmacological inhibition of RSK.
      Phosphorylation of METTL1 by PKB or RSK inactivated METTL1 in vitro, as
      did mutation of Ser27 to Asp or Glu. Expression of METTL1[S27D] or
      METTL1[S27E] did not rescue the growth phenotype of yeast lacking trm8. In
      contrast, expression of METTL1 or METTL1[S27A] partially rescued growth.
      These results demonstrate that METTL1 is inactivated by PKB and RSK in
      cells, and the potential implications of this finding are discussed.

TI  - Enhanced v-Src-induced oncogenic transformation in the absence of focal
      adhesion kinase is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
PG  - 673-84
AB  - We showed previously [K. Moissoglu, I.H. Gelman, J. Biol. Chem. 278 (2003)
      47946-47959] that oncogenic v-Src could induce 7- to 10-fold greater
      anchorage-independent growth (AIG) in FAK-null mouse embryo fibroblasts
      (MEF) compared to those expressing FAK. Here, we demonstrate that the
      enhanced AIG (eAIG) correlates with increased activation levels of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and not with changes in the protein
      levels of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, PDK1 or PTEN- modulators,
      and/or mediators of PI3K activity. eAIG could be blunted selectively by
      treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, or by overexpression of
      either the PI3K antagonist, PTEN, dominant-interfering alleles of PI3K or
      a downstream PI3K mediator, AKT, but not by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059,
      dominant-interfering alleles of MEK or the signal transducer and activator
      of transcription (STAT)-3. In contrast, RNAi-mediated knockdown of FAK
      resulted in increased v-Src-induced AIG. Expression of a constitutively
      active PI3K allele was sufficient to induce higher levels of AIG, whereas
      overexpression of v-Src produced only larger-sized colonies in soft agar.
      Interestingly, FAK was required for full activation of PI3K by PDGF
      whereas the activation of PI3K by insulin was significantly increased in
      FAK-/- cells. Thus, although FAK is dispensable for v-Src-induced
      oncogenic transformation in vitro, it may exert either positive or
      negative effects on signaling or motility depending on which pathways are
      activated in cancer cells.

TI  - Mechanisms of reactive oxygen species-dependent downregulation of insulin
      receptor substrate-1 by angiotensin II.
PG  - 1142-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin II has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the
      vascular complications of insulin resistance. Recently, serine
      phosphorylation and degradation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)
      were shown to inhibit Akt activation and reduce glucose uptake. Therefore,
      we examined the effects of chronic angiotensin II treatment on IRS-1
      phosphorylation and protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells
      (VSMCs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Western analysis, we found that
      angiotensin II (100 nmol/L; 18 hours) caused a 61+/-5% degradation of
      IRS-1 and abolished insulin-induced activation of Akt. Phosphorylation of
      IRS-1 on Ser307, which leads to subsequent IRS-1 degradation, was
      stimulated by angiotensin II. This phosphorylation was blocked by the Src
      inhibitor PP1 and by the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and ebselen. Stable
      overexpression of catalase abrogated angiotensin II-induced IRS-1
      phosphorylation and IRS-1 degradation. Similarly, a mutant
      phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) that cannot associate with Src
      abolished IRS-1 phosphorylation and degradation induced by angiotensin II.
      Proteasome inhibitors also prevented IRS-1 degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Thus,
      angiotensin II decreases IRS-1 protein levels in VSMCs via Src, PDK1, and
      reactive oxygen species-mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser307 and
      subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. These events impair insulin
      signaling and provide a molecular basis for understanding the clinical
      observation that angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists improve
      insulin resistance and its associated vasculopathies.

TI  - Expression and purification of active PKB kinase from Escherichia coli.
PG  - 162-9
AB  - PKB/Akt is a protein involved in control of apoptosis, proliferation and
      cellular metabolism, and it has been found to be activated in many
      cancers. Activation of PKB involves recruitment of the enzyme by its PH
      domain to the cell membrane, and phosphorylation at two residues, T308 and
      S473. To produce active PKB kinase from Escherichia coli, we constructed a
      derivative of PKB lacking the PH domain and mutated to glutamate at
      residues S124, T450 and the activating residue S473 (DeltaPH-PKB-EEE).
      DeltaPH-PKB-EEE was expressed in E. coli together with PDK1, the kinase
      responsible for phosphorylating PKB at T308, which was expressed as a
      GST-fusion. Full-length DeltaPH-PKB-EEE was obtained by using a double tag
      strategy: His6 at the N-terminus and FLAG at the C-terminus. The protein
      was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, followed by passage over
      an anti-FLAG column. The final purification step, anion exchange over a
      monoQ column, separated phosphorylated from unphosphorylated protein.
      Active recombinant PKB kinase was thus produced from E. coli, by a simple,
      reproducible procedure.

AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
      (PDK1)/Akt signaling pathway plays a key role in cancer cell growth,
      survival, and tumor angiogenesis and represents a promising target for
      anticancer drugs. Here, we describe three potent PDK1 inhibitors, BX-795,
      BX-912, and BX-320 (IC(50) = 11-30 nm) and their initial biological
      characterization. The inhibitors blocked PDK1/Akt signaling in tumor cells
      and inhibited the anchorage-dependent growth of a variety of tumor cell
      lines in culture or induced apoptosis. A number of cancer cell lines with
      elevated Akt activity were >30-fold more sensitive to growth inhibition by
      PDK1 inhibitors in soft agar than on tissue culture plastic, consistent
      with the cell survival function of the PDK1/Akt signaling pathway, which
      is particularly important for unattached cells. BX-320 inhibited the
      growth of LOX melanoma tumors in the lungs of nude mice after injection of
      tumor cells into the tail vein. The effect of BX-320 on cancer cell growth
      in vitro and in vivo indicates that PDK1 inhibitors may have clinical
      utility as anticancer agents.

TI  - Insulin stimulates postsynaptic density-95 protein translation via the
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling
      pathway.
PG  - 18543-50
AB  - Insulin receptors are highly enriched at neuronal synapses, but whose
      function remains unclear. Here we present evidence that brief incubations
      of rat hippocampal slices with insulin resulted in an increased protein
      expression of dendritic scaffolding protein postsynaptic density-95
      (PSD-95) in area CA1. This insulin-induced increase in the PSD-95 protein
      expression was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1024,
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin,
      translational inhibitors, anisomycin and rapamycin, but not by LY303511
      (an inactive analogue of LY294002), and transcriptional inhibitor,
      actinomycin D, suggesting that insulin regulates the translation of PSD-95
      by activating the receptor tyrosine kinase-PI3K-mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. A similar insulin-induced increase in
      the PSD-95 protein expression was detected after stimulation of the
      synaptic fractions isolated from the hippocampal neurons. Furthermore,
      insulin treatment did not affect the PSD-95 mRNA levels. In agreement,
      insulin rapidly induced the phosphorylation of
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), protein kinase B
      (Akt), and mTOR, effects that were prevented by the AG1024 and LY294002.
      We also show that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of 4E-binding
      protein 1 (4E-BP1) and p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) in a mTOR-dependent manner.
      Finally, we demonstrate the constitutive expression of PSD-95 mRNA in the
      synaptic fractions isolated from hippocampal neurons. Taken together,
      these findings suggest that activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling
      pathway is essential for the insulin-induced up-regulation of local PSD-95
      protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites and indicate a new molecular
      mechanism that may contribute to the modulation of synaptic function by
      insulin in hippocampal area CA1.

      is activated by the phosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
      1 (PDK1). Whether PDK1 is involved in the actions of Hsp90 on eNOS
      phosphorylation and function remains unknown. To address this issue, we
      treated bovine eNOS stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells
      with Hsp90 inhibitors and determined the alterations of phospho-eNOS, Akt,
      and PDK1. Both geldanamycin and radicicol, two structurally different
      Hsp90 inhibitors, selectively reduced serine 1179-phosphorylated eNOS,
      leading to decreased enzyme activity. In Hsp90-inhibited cells,
      eNOS-associated phospho-Akt was decreased, but the total amount of Akt
      associated with eNOS remained the same. Further studies showed that Hsp90
      inhibition dramatically depleted intracellular PDK1. Proteasome but not
      caspase blockade prevented the loss of PDK1 caused by Hsp90 inhibition.
      Silencing the PDK1 gene by small interfering RNA was sufficient to induce
      reduction of phospho-Akt and consequent loss of serine 1179-phosphorylated
      eNOS. Moreover, overexpression of PDK1, but not Akt, reversed Hsp90
      inhibition-induced loss of eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation and salvaged
      enzymatic activity. Thus, in addition to functioning as a module to
      recruit Akt to eNOS, Hsp90 also critically stabilized PDK1 by preventing
      it from proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of Hsp90 function resulted in
      PDK1 depletion and thus triggered a cascade of Akt deactivation, loss of
      eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation, and decrease of enzyme function.
