TI  - Reciprocal developmental pathways for the generation of pathogenic effector TH17 
      and regulatory T cells.
PG  - 235-8
AB  - On activation, T cells undergo distinct developmental pathways, attaining
      specialized properties and effector functions. T-helper (T(H)) cells are
      traditionally thought to differentiate into T(H)1 and T(H)2 cell subsets. T(H)1
      cells are necessary to clear intracellular pathogens and T(H)2 cells are
      important for clearing extracellular organisms. Recently, a subset of interleukin
      (IL)-17-producing T (T(H)17) cells distinct from T(H)1 or T(H)2 cells has been
      described and shown to have a crucial role in the induction of autoimmune tissue 
      injury. In contrast, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells inhibit
      autoimmunity and protect against tissue injury. Transforming growth factor-beta
      (TGF-beta) is a critical differentiation factor for the generation of T(reg)
      cells. Here we show, using mice with a reporter introduced into the endogenous
      Foxp3 locus, that IL-6, an acute phase protein induced during inflammation,
      completely inhibits the generation of Foxp3+ T(reg) cells induced by TGF-beta. We
      also demonstrate that IL-23 is not the differentiation factor for the generation 
      of T(H)17 cells. Instead, IL-6 and TGF-beta together induce the differentiation
      of pathogenic T(H)17 cells from naive T cells. Our data demonstrate a dichotomy
      in the generation of pathogenic (T(H)17) T cells that induce autoimmunity and
      regulatory (Foxp3+) T cells that inhibit autoimmune tissue injury.
