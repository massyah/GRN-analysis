TI  - Transcriptional regulatory networks in Th17 cell differentiation.
PG  - 146-52
AB  - Upon encountering antigen in the context of antigen presenting cells, naive
      CD4(+) T cells undergo differentiation into effector T helper (Th) cells, which
      can secrete high levels of cytokines and other immunomodulators to mediate host
      defense and tissue inflammation. During the past three years, the immunology
      field has witnessed an explosion of research advances in the biology of Th17
      cells, the most recently described subset of T helper cells, which play crucial
      roles in host immunity and inflammation. Here we review emerging data on
      transcriptional regulatory networks that govern the differentiation program of
      Th17 cells, and focus on how the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat coordinates
      this process in concert with diverse cytokine-induced transcription factors.
