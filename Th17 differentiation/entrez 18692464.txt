TI  - TGF-beta: a master of all T cell trades.
PG  - 392-404
AB  - A functional adaptive immune system depends on a diverse and self-tolerant
      population of T lymphocytes that are generated in the thymus and maintained in
      the peripheral lymphoid organs. Recent studies have defined the cytokine
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as a critical regulator of thymic T
      cell development as well as a crucial player in peripheral T cell homeostasis,
      tolerance to self antigens, and T cell differentiation during the immune
      response. The unique mechanism of TGF-beta activation and the plasticity of
      TGF-beta signaling create a stage for TGF-beta to integrate signals from multiple
      cell types and environmental cues to regulate T cells.
