TI  - Signal transduction and Th17 cell differentiation.
PG  - 599-611
AB  - The paradigm of effector T helper cell differentiation into either Th1 or Th2
      lineages has been notably shaken by the discovery of a third lineage of cells
      that selectively produce interleukin (IL)-17. Characterization of this new
      subset, referred to as Th17, has provided exciting new insights into
      immunoregulation, host defense and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
      Additionally, the discovery of this T cell subset has offered a fresh look at
      such concepts as lineage commitment and terminal differentiation. The
      transcriptional regulatory events and epigenetic modifications that control these
      processes are diverse and complex, and despite the rapid pace at which data
      continue to accumulate, many questions remain to be answered. Here we review our 
      current understanding of the signaling pathways, molecular interactions and
      transcriptional events that lead to Th17 differentiation and effector function,
      as well as the epigenetic modifications that accompany them.
