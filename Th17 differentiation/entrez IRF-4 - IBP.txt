TI  - IRF-4-binding protein inhibits interleukin-17 and interleukin-21
      production by controlling the activity of IRF-4 transcription factor.
PG  - 899-911
AB  - The T helper 17 (Th17) cell lineage is important in inflammatory and
      autoimmune responses, via its ability to produce interleukin-17 (IL-17)
      and IL-21. Given the potentially deleterious effects of Th17 cells, their
      generation needs to be strictly controlled. IRF-4 is a transcription
      factor that has recently emerged as a key regulator of Th17 cell
      differentiation. Here, we showed that mice deficient in a previously
      isolated protein, IBP (IRF-4-binding protein), rapidly developed
      rheumatoid arthritis-like joint disease and large-vessel vasculitis. The
      pathology was associated with an enhanced responsiveness of T cells to low
      levels of stimulation and with the inappropriate synthesis of IL-17 and
      IL-21. <39>IBP sequestered IRF-4 and prevented it from targeting the
      transcriptional regulatory regions of the genes that encode IL-17 and
      IL-21. Thus, IBP appears to be important in preventing T cell-mediated
      autoimmunity by ensuring that the production of IL-17 and IL-21 does not
      occur in response to self-antigens.

TI  - Loss of IRF-4-binding protein leads to the spontaneous development of
      systemic autoimmunity.
PG  - 703-14
AB  - IFN regulatory factor 4-binding (IRF-4-binding) protein (IBP) is a novel
      type of activator of Rho GTPases that is recruited to the immunological
      synapse upon TCR stimulation. Here we demonstrate that loss of IBP leads
      to the spontaneous development of a systemic autoimmune disorder
      characterized by the accumulation of effector/memory T cells and IgG+ B
      cells, profound hypergammaglobulinemia, and autoantibody production.
      Similar to human SLE, this syndrome primarily affects females. T cells
      from IBP-deficient mice are resistant to death in vitro as well as in vivo
      and exhibit selective defects in effector function. In the absence of IBP,
      T cells respond suboptimally to TCR engagement, as demonstrated by
      diminished ERK1/2 activation, decreased c-Fos induction, impaired
      immunological synapse formation, and defective actin polymerization.
      Transduction of IBP-deficient T cells with a WT IBP protein, but not with
      an IBP mutant lacking the Dbl-like domain required for Rho GTPase
      activation, rescues the cytoskeletal defects exhibited by these cells.
      Collectively, these findings indicate that IBP, a novel regulator of Rho
      GTPases, is required for optimal T cell effector function, lymphocyte
      homeostasis, and the prevention of systemic autoimmunity.
