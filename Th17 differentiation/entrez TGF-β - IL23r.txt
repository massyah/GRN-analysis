TI  - Induction of Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment improves survival in
      a murine model of pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 4063-71
AB  - An important mechanism by which pancreatic cancer avoids antitumor
      immunity is by recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the tumor
      microenvironment. Recent studies suggest that suppressor Tregs and
      effector Th17 cells share a common lineage and differentiate based on the
      presence of certain cytokines in the microenvironment. Because IL-6 in the
      presence of TGF-beta has been shown to inhibit Treg development and induce
      Th17 cells, we hypothesized that altering the tumor cytokine environment
      could induce Th17 and reverse tumor-associated immune suppression. Pan02
      murine pancreatic tumor cells that secrete TGF-beta were transduced with
      the gene encoding IL-6. C57BL/6 mice were injected s.c. with wild-type
      (WT), empty vector (EV), or IL-6-transduced Pan02 cells (IL-6 Pan02) to
      investigate the impact of IL-6 secretion in the tumor microenvironment.
      Mice bearing IL-6 Pan02 tumors demonstrated significant delay in tumor
      growth and better overall median survival compared with mice bearing WT or
      EV Pan02 tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an increase in
      Th17 cells (CD4(+)IL-23R(+) cells and CD4(+)IL-17(+) cells) in tumors of
      the IL-6 Pan02 group compared with WT or EV Pan02 tumors. The upregulation
      of IL-17-secreting CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was substantiated
      at the cellular level by flow cytometry and ELISPOT assay and mRNA level
      for retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammat and IL-23R by RT-PCR.
      Thus, the addition of IL-6 to the tumor microenvironment skews the balance
      toward Th17 cells in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. The delayed
      tumor growth and improved survival suggests that induction of Th17 in the
      tumor microenvironment produces an antitumor effect.

TI  - Interferon beta inhibits the Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune response in
      patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 641-5
AB  - Interferon (IFN)beta has been used over the past decades as an effective
      first-line therapy against relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR MS),
      however its in vivo operative mechanisms of action are not fully
      understood. Current advances in our understanding of the development of
      the autoimmune response, including its induction by a recently discovered
      Th17 cell lineage, may allow us to identify the biomarkers of this
      effective therapy. Our in vitro human studies have characterized IFNbeta's
      immunoregulatory effects on Th17 cell differentiation. IFNbeta inhibited
      IL-1beta, IL-23 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (which induce
      Th17 cell differentiation), and induced IL-27, IL-12p35 and IL-10 (which
      suppress it) in dendritic cells (DCs) and B-cells. The effect on IL-1beta,
      IL-23 and IL-27 production in DCs was mediated by the up-regulation of
      Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and its downstream signaling molecules.
      IFNbeta's direct effect on naive T-cells suppressed in vitro Th17
      differentiation by inhibiting Th17 cell lineage markers (retinoic
      acid-related orphan nuclear hormone receptor (ROR)c, IL-17A, IL-23R and
      CCR6), and by inducing IL-10 production by CD4 cells, which constrains
      Th17 cell expansion. Our results have identified novel therapeutic
      mechanisms of IFNbeta, which inhibit Th17 cell differentiation in the
      context of the autoimmune response in MS.

TI  - Age-related T-cell cytokine profile parallels corneal disease severity in
      Sjogren's syndrome-like keratoconjunctivitis sicca in CD25KO mice.
PG  - 246-58
AB  - OBJECTIVES: IL-2ralpha (CD25)(-/-) mice develop autoimmunity and
      lymphoproliferative disorders, including SS-like disease. The objective of
      this study was to evaluate the severity of corneal epithelial disease and
      T-cell cytokine profile in the ocular surface tissues of CD25KO mice.
      METHODS: CD25KO mice were evaluated at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Corneal
      epithelial smoothness and corneal permeability were measured. Phenotype of
      infiltrating lymphocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Th-1, -2
      and -17 associated factors were measured by real-time PCR in cornea and
      conjunctiva and by Luminex immunobead assay in tears. RESULTS: Compared
      with 8-week-old wild-type (WT) mice, CD25KO mice of the same age had
      significantly greater corneal irregularity and a significant increase in
      the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells infiltrating the conjunctiva.
      CD25KO mice had significantly higher levels of IL-6, TGF-beta1, IL-23R,
      IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, CCL20, IL-10, GATA-3 and IFN-gamma mRNA transcripts
      in their cornea and conjunctiva than WT mice at 8 weeks. IL-17A and IL-17F
      mRNA transcripts peaked at 12 weeks, whereas IFN-gamma spiked at 16 weeks
      in CD25KO mice. Increased expression of IL-17A and IL-17F at 12 weeks in
      CD25KO mice was accompanied by a worsening of corneal surface parameters
      and an increase of CD4(+) T cell infiltrating the cornea. CONCLUSIONS:
      Disruption of IL-2 signalling in CD25KO mice results in age-dependent
      SS-like autoimmune lacrimal-keratoconjunctivitis. A mix of Th-1 and Th-17
      cytokines was detected. The peak severity of corneal epithelial disease
      corresponded to the peak of IL-17 expression.

TI  - Flt3-Ligand Decreases Th17 Cells and SOCS Proteins in the Lung of House
      Dust Mite-sensitized and Challenged Mice.
AB  - We previously reported that Flt3-L reversed airway hyper-responsiveness
      (AHR) and airway inflammation, increased the number of regulatory
      CD11c(high)CD8alpha(high)CD11b(low) dendritic cells and
      CD4+CD25+ICOS+Foxp3+IL-10+ T-regulatory cells in the lung of
      allergen-sensitized and challenged mice. In this study, we evaluated the
      effect of Flt3-L on Th17 cells and expression of SOCS proteins in the
      lungs of house dust mite (HDM)-sensitized and challenged mice. BALB/c mice
      were sensitized and challenged with HDM and AHR to methacholine was
      established. Mice were treated with Flt3-L (5 mug, i.p.) daily for 10
      days. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and TGF-beta in the BALF
      were examined by ELISA. Flt3-L treatment reversed existing AHR to
      methacholine and substantially decreased eosinophils, neutrophils, IL-5,
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and TGF-beta levels in the BALF. HDM-sensitized and
      challenged mice showed a significant increase in lung
      CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+CD25- T-cells with high expression of ROR-gammat
      transcripts. However, administration of Flt3-L substantially decreased the
      number of lung CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+CD25- T-cells with significantly decreased
      expression of ROR-gammat mRNA in these cells. HDM sensitization caused a
      significant increase in the expression of SOCS-1, -3 and -5 in the lung.
      Flt3-L treatment abolished the increase in SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 protein,
      whereas SOCS-5 expression was significantly reduced. These data suggest
      that the therapeutic effect of Flt3-L in reversing the hallmarks of
      allergic asthma in a mouse model is mediated by decreasing IL-6 and
      TGF-beta levels in the BALF, which in turn decrease
      CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+ROR-gammat+CD25- T-cells and the expression of SOCS-1 and
      SOCS-3 in the lung of HDM-sensitized and challenged mice.

TI  - The tumor-promoting actions of TNF-alpha involve TNFR1 and IL-17 in
      ovarian cancer in mice and humans.
PG  - 3011-23
LID - 39065 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI39065 [doi]
AB  - Cytokines orchestrate the tumor-promoting interplay between malignant
      cells and the immune system. In many experimental and human cancers, the
      cytokine TNF-alpha is an important component of this interplay, but its
      effects are pleiotropic and therefore remain to be completely defined.
      Using a mouse model of ovarian cancer in which either TNF receptor 1
      (TNFR1) signaling was manipulated in different leukocyte populations or
      TNF-alpha was neutralized by antibody treatment, we found that this
      inflammatory cytokine maintained TNFR1-dependent IL-17 production by CD4+
      cells and that this led to myeloid cell recruitment into the tumor
      microenvironment and enhanced tumor growth. Consistent with this, in
      patients with advanced cancer, treatment with the TNF-alpha-specific
      antibody infliximab substantially reduced plasma IL-17 levels.
      Furthermore, expression of IL-1R and IL-23R was downregulated in CD4+CD25-
      cells isolated from ascites of ovarian cancer patients treated with
      infliximab. We have also shown that genes ascribed to the Th17 pathway map
      closely with the TNF-alpha signaling pathway in ovarian cancer biopsy
      samples, showing particularly high levels of expression of genes encoding
      IL-23, components of the NF-kappaB system, TGF-beta1, and proteins
      involved in neutrophil activation. We conclude that chronic production of
      TNF-alpha in the tumor microenvironment increases myeloid cell recruitment
      in an IL-17-dependent manner that contributes to the tumor-promoting
      action of this proinflammatory cytokine.

TI  - Interleukin-1 and IL-23 induce innate IL-17 production from gammadelta T
      cells, amplifying Th17 responses and autoimmunity.
PG  - 331-41
AB  - Th17 cells, CD4(+) T cells that secrete interleukin-17 (IL-17), are
      pathogenic in autoimmune diseases and their development and expansion is
      driven by the cytokines IL-6, TGF-beta, IL-21, IL-1, and IL-23. However,
      there are also innate sources of IL-17. Here, we show that gammadelta T
      cells express IL-23R and the transcription factor RORgammat and produce
      IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 in response to IL-1beta and IL-23, without T cell
      receptor engagement. IL-17-producing gammadelta T cells were found at high
      frequency in the brain of mice with experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE). gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and
      IL-23 promoted IL-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and increased
      susceptibility to EAE, suggesting that gammadelta T cells act in an
      amplification loop for IL-17 production by Th17 cells. Our findings
      demonstrate that gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and IL-23 are an
      important source of innate IL-17 and IL-21 and provide an alternative
      mechanism whereby IL-1 and IL-23 may mediate autoimmune inflammation.

TI  - A Th17-like developmental process leads to CD8(+) Tc17 cells with reduced
      cytotoxic activity.
PG  - 1716-25
AB  - Activation of naive CD8(+) T cells with antigen in the absence of skewing
      cytokines triggers their differentiation into effector CTL, which induces
      death of target cells. We show that CD8(+) T cells activated in the
      presence of the cytokines IL-6 or IL-21 plus TGF-beta similar to CD4(+) T
      cells, develop into IL-17-producing (Tc17) cells. These cells display
      greatly suppressed cytotoxic function along with low levels of the CTL
      markers: T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin, granzyme B and
      IFN-gamma. Instead, these cells express hallmark molecules of Th17 program
      including retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)gammat,
      RORalpha, IL-21 and IL-23R. The expression of the type 17 master regulator
      RORgammat is causally linked to Tc17 generation, because its
      overexpression stimulates production of IL-17 in the presence of IL-6 or
      IL-21. Both, upregulation of the type 17 program as well as suppression of
      CTL differentiation are STAT3 dependent. Furthermore, Tc17 cells producing
      IL-17 but not granzyme B are also detectable in EAE, a mouse model for
      multiple sclerosis. Our data point to the existence of mutually exclusive
      CTL and Tc17 developmental pathways in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - TGF-beta is necessary for induction of IL-23R and Th17 differentiation by
      IL-6 and IL-23.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - TGF-beta and IL-6 induce Th17 differentiation, and IL-23 is required for
      expansion and maintenance of Th17 cells. Recently, it was shown that IL-6
      up-regulates IL-23R mRNA in naive CD4+ T cells and therefore IL-6 and
      IL-23 synergistically promote Th17 differentiation. However, the molecular
      mechanism whereby IL-6 and IL-23 induce Th17 differentiation and the
      relevance to TGF-beta remain unknown. Here, we found that IL-6
      up-regulated IL-23R mRNA expression, and IL-6 and IL-23 synergistically
      augmented its protein expression. The combination induced Th17
      differentiation, and TGF-beta1 further enhanced it. IL-6 augmented
      endogenous TGF-beta1 mRNA expression, whereas the amount of TGF-beta
      produced was not enough to induce Th17 differentiation by IL-6 alone.
      However, unexpectedly, the up-regulation of IL-23R and induction of Th17
      differentiation by IL-6 and IL-23 were almost completely inhibited by
      anti-TGF-beta. These results suggest that the induction of IL-23R and Th17
      differentiation by IL-6 and IL-23 is mediated through endogenously
      produced TGF-beta.

TI  - Properties and origin of human Th17 cells.
PG  - 3-7
AB  - Following the discovery of distinct subsets of CD4+ T-cell effectors,
      known as type 1 T helper (Th1) and type 2 Th (Th2), which mainly produce
      interferon (IFN)-gamma or interleukin (IL)-4, respectively, a novel
      population has been discovered and named as type 17 Th (Th17) because of
      the its unique ability to produce IL-17A. Murine Th17 cells play a
      protective role against extracellular bacteria and fungi by inducing an
      inflammatory response characterized not only by the presence of
      mononuclear cells but also of neutrophil granulocytes. Murine Th17 cells
      have been considered as major players in the pathogenesis of murine
      autoimmune disorders while Th1 cells seemed to have a protective role.
      However, this concept has recently been challenged by the demonstration
      that either Th17 or Th1 cells may be pathogenic even in murine models of
      autoimmune disorders. Th17 cells have also been identified in human blood
      and inflamed tissues, but they seem to exhibit different features from
      murine Th17 cells. First, human Th17 are characterized by the surface
      expression of CCR6 and IL-23R, but also of IL-12Rbeta2 and CD161. Second,
      human Th17 cells express T-bet in addition to retinoic acid-related orphan
      receptor (ROR)gammat and can be induced to produce IFN-gamma in addition
      to IL-17A in the presence of IL-12, thus suggesting a close developmental
      relationship with Th1 cells. Finally, while murine Th17 originate from a
      precursor common to Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells when IL-6 is produced
      in combination with TGF-beta, human Th17 cells originate from CD161+CD4+
      precursors, which constitutively express RORgammat and IL-23R, in response
      to the combined activity of IL-1beta and IL-23. By contrast, TGF-beta does
      not play a direct role in human Th17 differentiation, but can only favour
      their expansion by inhibiting T-bet expression and the development of Th1
      cells.

TI  - Down-regulation of Gfi-1 expression by TGF-beta is important for
      differentiation of Th17 and CD103+ inducible regulatory T cells.
PG  - 329-41
AB  - Growth factor independent 1 (Gfi-1), a transcriptional repressor, is
      transiently induced during T cell activation. Interleukin (IL) 4 further
      induces Gfi-1, resulting in optimal Th2 cell expansion. We report a second
      important function of Gfi-1 in CD4 T cells: prevention of alternative
      differentiation by Th2 cells, and inhibition of differentiation of naive
      CD4 T cells to either Th17 or inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells. In
      Gfi1(-/-) Th2 cells, the Rorc, Il23r, and Cd103 loci showed histone 3
      lysine 4 trimethylation modifications that were lacking in wild-type Th2
      cells, implying that Gfi-1 is critical for epigenetic regulation of Th17
      and iTreg cell-related genes in Th2 cells. Enforced Gfi-1 expression
      inhibited IL-17 production and iTreg cell differentiation. Furthermore, a
      key inducer of both Th17 and iTreg cell differentiation, transforming
      growth factor beta, repressed Gfi-1 expression, implying a reciprocal
      negative regulation of CD4 T cell fate determination. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation showed direct binding of the Gfi-1-lysine-specific
      demethylase 1 repressive complex to the intergenic region of Il17a/Il17f
      loci and to intron 1 of Cd103. T cell-specific Gfi1 conditional knockout
      mice displayed a striking delay in the onset of experimental allergic
      encephalitis correlated with a dramatic increase of Foxp3(+)CD103(+) CD4 T
      cells. Thus, Gfi-1 plays a critical role both in enhancing Th2 cell
      expansion and in repressing induction of Th17 and CD103(+) iTreg cells.

TI  - The phenotype of human Th17 cells and their precursors, the cytokines that
      mediate their differentiation and the role of Th17 cells in inflammation.
PG  - 1361-8
AB  - T helper 17 (T(h)17) cells represent a new subset of CD4+ effector T cells
      which have been described in both mice and humans. However, some
      differences seem to exist between murine and human T(h)17 cells with
      regard to their features, origin and role in immunopathology. Murine
      T(h)17 cells share their developmental origin with Foxp3+ Treg cells,
      indeed naive T-cell precursors can be differentiated to regulatory T
      (Treg) cells by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) alone, whereas
      the contemporaneous presence of TGF-beta and IL-6 gives origin to T(h)17
      cells. Human T(h)17 cells which consistently express the CC chemokine
      receptor 6 and the equivalent of the murine NK1.1, CD161, appear to
      exclusively originate in response to IL-1beta and IL-23 from a small
      subset of CD161+CD4+ T-cell precursors detectable in the thymus and in
      umbilical cord blood. These cells constitutively express the
      T(h)17-driving transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor
      (ROR)gamma t and the IL-23R and can also give origin to T(h)1 cells or
      T(h)2 cells under the appropriate polarizing conditions. By contrast,
      human CD161-naive T cells only give rise to T(h)1 and T(h)2 cells, but not
      T(h)17 cells. TGF-beta may not exert a direct critical role in human
      T(h)17 cell differentiation, but indirectly favours their development by
      inhibiting the development of T(h)1 cells, which are much more susceptible
      than T(h)17 cells to its suppressive activity on cell proliferation.
      Moreover, while murine T(h)17 are pathogenic in some murine models of
      autoimmunity where T(h)1 cells seem to play a protective role, both T(h)17
      and T(h)1 certainly contribute to the pathogenesis of human autoimmune and
      other chronic inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Retinoic acid increases Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and inhibits development
      of Th17 cells by enhancing TGF-beta-driven Smad3 signaling and inhibiting
      IL-6 and IL-23 receptor expression.
PG  - 2277-84
AB  - The de novo generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the
      peripheral immune compartment and the differentiation of Th17 cells both
      require TGF-beta, and IL-6 and IL-21 are switch factors that drive the
      development of Th17 cells at the expense of Treg cell generation. The
      major vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA) not only enforces
      the generation of Treg cells but also inhibits the differentiation of Th17
      cells. Herein we show that RA enhances TGF-beta signaling by increasing
      the expression and phosphorylation of Smad3, and this results in increased
      Foxp3 expression even in the presence of IL-6 or IL-21. RA also inhibits
      the expression of IL-6Ralpha, IRF-4, and IL-23R and thus inhibits Th17
      development. In vitro, RA significantly promotes Treg cell conversion, but
      in vivo during the development of experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis it does not increase the frequency of Treg cells in the
      face of an ongoing inflammation. However, RA suppresses the disease very
      efficiently by inhibiting proinflammatory T cell responses, especially
      pathogenic Th17 responses. These data not only identify the signaling
      mechanisms by which RA can affect both Treg cell and Th17 differentiation,
      but they also highlight that in vivo during an autoimmune reaction, RA
      suppresses autoimmunity mainly by inhibiting the generation of effector
      Th17 cells.

TI  - TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits T(H)17 cell differentiation by
      antagonizing RORgammat function.
PG  - 236-40
AB  - T helper cells that produce IL-17 (T(H)17 cells) promote autoimmunity in
      mice and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory
      diseases. At mucosal surfaces, T(H)17 cells are thought to protect the
      host from infection, whereas regulatory T (T(reg)) cells control immune
      responses and inflammation triggered by the resident microflora.
      Differentiation of both cell types requires transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGF-beta), but depends on distinct transcription factors:
      RORgammat (encoded by Rorc(gammat)) for T(H)17 cells and Foxp3 for T(reg)
      cells. How TGF-beta regulates the differentiation of T cells with opposing
      activities has been perplexing. Here we demonstrate that, together with
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, TGF-beta orchestrates T(H)17 cell
      differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. At low
      concentrations, TGF-beta synergizes with interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-21
      (refs 9-11) to promote IL-23 receptor (Il23r) expression, favouring T(H)17
      cell differentiation. High concentrations of TGF-beta repress IL23r
      expression and favour Foxp3+ T(reg) cells. RORgammat and Foxp3 are
      co-expressed in naive CD4+ T cells exposed to TGF-beta and in a subset of
      T cells in the small intestinal lamina propria of the mouse. In vitro,
      TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits RORgammat function, at least in part
      through their interaction. Accordingly, lamina propria T cells that
      co-express both transcription factors produce less IL-17 (also known as
      IL-17a) than those that express RORgammat alone. IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23
      relieve Foxp3-mediated inhibition of RORgammat, thereby promoting T(H)17
      cell differentiation. Therefore, the decision of antigen-stimulated cells
      to differentiate into either T(H)17 or T(reg) cells depends on the
      cytokine-regulated balance of RORgammat and Foxp3.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta induces development of the T(H)17 lineage.
PG  - 231-4
AB  - A new lineage of effector CD4+ T cells characterized by production of
      interleukin (IL)-17, the T-helper-17 (T(H)17) lineage, was recently
      described based on developmental and functional features distinct from
      those of classical T(H)1 and T(H)2 lineages. Like T(H)1 and T(H)2, T(H)17
      cells almost certainly evolved to provide adaptive immunity tailored to
      specific classes of pathogens, such as extracellular bacteria. Aberrant
      T(H)17 responses have been implicated in a growing list of autoimmune
      disorders. T(H)17 development has been linked to IL-23, an IL-12 cytokine
      family member that shares with IL-12 a common subunit, IL-12p40 (ref. 8).
      The IL-23 and IL-12 receptors also share a subunit, IL-12Rbeta1, that
      pairs with unique, inducible components, IL-23R and IL-12Rbeta2, to confer
      receptor responsiveness. Here we identify transforming growth factor-beta
      (TGF-beta) as a cytokine critical for commitment to T(H)17 development.
      TGF-beta acts to upregulate IL-23R expression, thereby conferring
      responsiveness to IL-23. Although dispensable for the development of
      IL-17-producing T cells in vitro and in vivo, IL-23 is required for host
      protection against a bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. The action
      of TGF-beta on naive T cells is antagonized by interferon-gamma and IL-4,
      thus providing a mechanism for divergence of the T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17
      lineages.
