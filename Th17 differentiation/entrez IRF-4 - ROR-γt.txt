TI  - Transcriptional regulation of T helper 17 cell differentiation.
PG  - 484-91
AB  - The third lineage of T helper subsets, Th17, has recently been identified
      as an IL- 17-producing CD4+ Th cell, and its functions and regulatory
      mechanisms have been extensively characterized in immune responses.
      Functional studies have provided evidence that Th17 cells are important
      for the modulation of autoimmune responses, such as chronic asthma,
      rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and multiple sclerosis.
      Murine Th17 cell differentiation is enhanced by the coordinated functions
      of distinct cytokines including TGFbeta, IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23, whereas
      IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-27 inhibit its differentiation. In addition,
      Th17 cells are controlled by several transcription factors such as
      RORgammat, IRF4, BATF, FoxP3, T-bet, PPARgamma, E-FABP, and SOCSs. This
      review focuses on the functions and regulatory mechanisms of several
      transcription factors in the control of Th17 cell differentiation.

TI  - Critical regulation of early Th17 cell differentiation by interleukin-1
      signaling.
PG  - 576-87
AB  - T helper (Th) 17 cells have been recently discovered in both mouse and
      human. Here we show that interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling on T cells is
      critically required for the early programming of Th17 cell lineage and
      Th17 cell-mediated autoimmunity. IL-1 receptor1 expression in T cells,
      which was induced by IL-6, was necessary for the induction of experimental
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis and for early Th17 cell differentiation in
      vivo. Moreover, IL-1 signaling in T cells was required in dendritic
      cell-mediated Th17 cell differentiation from naive or regulatory
      precursors and IL-1 synergized with IL-6 and IL-23 to regulate Th17 cell
      differentiation and maintain cytokine expression in effector Th17 cells.
      Importantly, IL-1 regulated the expression of the transcription factors
      IRF4 and RORgammat during Th17 cell differentiation; overexpression of
      these two factors resulted in IL-1-independent Th17 cell polarization. Our
      data thus indicate a critical role of IL-1 in Th17 cell differentiation
      and this pathway may serve as a unique target for Th17 cell-mediated
      immunopathology.

TI  - IRF4 is essential for IL-21-mediated induction, amplification, and
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype.
PG  - 20846-51
AB  - Differentiation of murine T-helper (Th) 17 cells is induced by antigenic
      stimulation and the sequential action of the cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and
      IL-23, along with TGFbeta. Current dogma proposes that IL-6 induces IL-21,
      which, in a STAT3-dependent manner, amplifies its own transcription,
      contributes to IL-17 production, and, moreover, promotes the expression of
      the IL-23 receptor. This, in turn, prepares cells for IL-23-mediated
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype. Here we demonstrate that these
      effects of IL-21 on Th17 differentiation are completely dependent on IFN
      regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). After culturing in the presence of IL-21 plus
      TGFbeta, IRF4-deficient (Irf4(-/-)) Th cells showed a profound intrinsic
      defect in IL-17 production and in the autocrine IL-21 loop. Likewise, the
      levels of IL-23 receptor and the lineage-specific orphan nuclear receptors
      RORalpha and RORgammat were diminished, whereas the T regulatory (Treg)
      transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) was strongly up-regulated,
      consistent with the reciprocal relationship between Th17 and Treg
      development. Despite this loss of IL-21 functions, IL-21-induced STAT3
      activation was unimpaired and induced normal Socs3 expression. Forced
      expression of Foxp3 in WT cells inhibited IL-21-mediated IL-17 production,
      suggesting that the increase in Foxp3 contributes to the Irf4(-/-)
      phenotype. Additionally, the low levels of RORalpha and RORgammat are also
      partially responsible, because simultaneous overexpression of both
      proteins restored IL-17 production in Irf4(-/-) cells to some extent.
      These data highlight IRF4 as a decisive factor during the IL-21-mediated
      steps of Th17 development by influencing the balance of Foxp3, RORalpha,
      and RORgammat.

TI  - The development of inflammatory T(H)-17 cells requires
      interferon-regulatory factor 4.
PG  - 958-66
AB  - Interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is essential for the development of
      T helper type 2 cells. Here we show that IRF4 is also critical for the
      generation of interleukin 17-producing T helper cells (T(H)-17 cells),
      which are associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
      IRF4-deficient (Irf4(-/-)) mice did not develop experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis, and T helper cells from such mice failed to
      differentiate into T(H)-17 cells. Transfer of wild-type T helper cells
      into Irf4(-/-) mice rendered the mice susceptible to experimental
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Irf4(-/-) T helper cells had less expression
      of RORgammat and more expression of Foxp3, transcription factors important
      for the differentiation of T(H)-17 and regulatory T cells, respectively.
      Altered regulation of both transcription factors contributed to the
      phenotype of Irf4(-/-) T helper cells. Our data position IRF4 at the
      center of T helper cell development, influencing not only T helper type 2
      but also T(H)-17 differentiation.
