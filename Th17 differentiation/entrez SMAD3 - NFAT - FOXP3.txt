TI  - Bidirectional immunoregulation of calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus on
      FOXP3 transcription?
AB  - The imbalance between regulatory T cells (Treg) and effector T cells is
      important for maintaining of psoriasis vulgaris. FOXP3 is a master control
      transcription factor for the development and function of Tregs and is
      critical for transcriptional repression. Tacrolimus is effective in
      treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. Data show that tacrolimus has multiple
      impacts on FOXP3, but the exact pharmacological mechanism of tacrolimus on
      FOXP3 have yet to be elucidated. We herein suggest the bidirectional
      immunoregulation of tacrolimus on FOXP3. High concentration of tacrolimus
      renders the cooperation of NFAT with STAT6 and NF-kappaB to activate GATA3
      transcription. On the contrary, low concentration of tacrolimus results in
      higher nucleus level of NFAT, which directly binds to FOXP3 enhancer
      and/or cooperates with Smad3 to activate FOXP3 transcription. Further
      studies using loss of function and over-expression methods are needed to
      determine the detailed molecules involved in this bidirectional
      immunoregulation of tacrolimus on FOXP3.

TI  - Differential regulation of Foxp3 and IL-17 expression in CD4 T helper
      cells by IRAK-1.
PG  - 5763-9
AB  - Host immune responses are finely regulated by the opposing effects of Th17
      and T regulatory (Treg) cells. Treg cells help to dampen inflammatory
      processes and Th17 cells facilitate various aspects of immune activation.
      The differentiation of Th cells depends on a unique combination of
      stimulants and subsequent activation of diverse transcription factors. In
      particular, cooperative activation of NFAT and Smad3 leads to the
      induction of Treg cells, and cooperation among STAT3 and Smad3 switches to
      the induction of Th17 cells. We have previously shown that the IL-1
      receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) selectively activates STAT3 and
      inactivates NFAT. Physiological studies have shown that IRAK-1(-/-) mice
      are protected from developing various inflammatory diseases, including
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and atherosclerosis with unknown
      mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that IRAK-1 plays a critical
      modulatory role in the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. Following
      stimulation with TCR agonists and TGFbeta, IRAK-1(-/-) CD4 Th cells
      display elevated nuclear NFATc2 levels and increased interaction of NFATc2
      and Smad3, resulting in increased expression of Foxp3, a key marker for
      Treg cells. IRAK-1(-/-) mice have constitutively higher populations of
      Treg cells. In contrast, when stimulated with TCR agonists together with
      IL-6 and TGF-beta, IRAK-1(-/-) CD4 Th cells exhibit attenuated STAT3
      Ser727 phosphorylation and reduced expression of IL-17 and RORgamma t
      compared with wild-type cells. Correspondingly, IRAK-1 deletion results in
      decreased IL-17 expression and dampened inflammatory responses in acute
      and chronic inflammatory mice models. Our data provides mechanistic
      explanation for the anti-inflammatory phenotypes of IRAK-1(-/-) mice.

TI  - Smad3 and NFAT cooperate to induce Foxp3 expression through its enhancer.
PG  - 194-202
AB  - The transcription factor Foxp3 is involved in the differentiation,
      function and survival of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. Details of
      the mechanism underlying the induction of Foxp3 expression remain unknown,
      because studies of the transcriptional regulation of the Foxp3 gene are
      limited by the small number of T(reg) cells in mononuclear cell
      populations. Here we have generated a model system for analyzing Foxp3
      induction and, by using this system with primary T cells, we have
      identified an enhancer element in this gene. The transcription factors
      Smad3 and NFAT are required for activity of this Foxp3 enhancer, and both
      factors are essential for histone acetylation in the enhancer region and
      induction of Foxp3. These biochemical properties that define Foxp3
      expression explain many of the effects of transforming growth factor-beta
      on the function of Foxp3+ T(reg) cells.
