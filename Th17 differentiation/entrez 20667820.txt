TI  - Smad2 positively regulates the generation of Th17 cells.
PG  - 29039-43
AB  - Development of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and pro-inflammatory Th17 cells from
      naive CD4(+) T cells requires transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
      signaling. Although Smad4 and Smad3 have been previously shown to regulate Treg
      cell induction by TGF-beta, they are not required in the development of Th17
      cells. Thus, how TGF-beta regulates Th17 cell differentiation remains unclear. In
      this study, we found that TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 expression was significantly
      reduced in the absence of Smad2. More importantly, Smad2 deficiency led to
      reduced Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo. In the experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis model, Smad2 deficiency in T cells significantly ameliorated
      disease severity and reduced generation of Th17 cells. Furthermore, we found that
      Smad2 associated with retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptor-gammat
      (RORgammat) and enhanced RORgammat-induced Th17 cell generation. These results
      demonstrate that Smad2 positively regulates the generation of inflammatory Th17
      cells.
