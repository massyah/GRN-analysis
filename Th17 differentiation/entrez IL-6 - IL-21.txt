TI  - Impaired T(H)17 responses in patients with chronic mucocutaneous
      candidiasis with and without autoimmune
      polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence implicates T(H)17 cytokines in
      protection against Candida species infections, but the clinical relevance
      is not clear. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is a heterogeneous
      syndrome with the unifying feature of selective susceptibility to chronic
      candidiasis. Different subgroups with distinct clinical features are
      recognized, including autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal
      dystrophy (APECED), CMC with hypothyroidism, and isolated CMC.
      Understanding immune defects in patients with CMC will define cellular and
      molecular mechanisms crucial for protection against Candida species in
      human subjects. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether impaired T(H)17
      responses underlie susceptibility to Candida species infections and
      whether the same defect is present in different CMC subgroups. METHODS: We
      assessed T(H)17 responses of PBMCs to Candida and non-Candida species
      stimuli by measuring IL-17, IL-22, IL-21, IL-6, IL-23, and IFN-gamma
      cytokine production using cytokine arrays and intracellular
      cytokine-producing cell numbers and proliferation with flow cytometry.
      PBMCs from healthy subjects and unaffected family members served as
      controls. RESULTS: In patients with CMC with hypothyroidism, T(H)17 cells
      demonstrated decreased proliferation and IL-17 production in response to
      Candida species. In contrast, in patients with APECED, T(H)17 cell
      proliferation and IL-17 production were normal unless exposed to APECED
      plasma, which inhibited both functions in both APECED and normal PBMCs.
      Candida species-stimulated IL-22 production was impaired in all patients
      with CMC, whereas IL-6 and IL-23 responses were unaltered. CONCLUSION: An
      impaired T(H)17 response to Candida species, although mediated by
      different mechanisms, was present in all CMC subgroups studied and might
      be a common factor predisposing to chronic candidiasis.

TI  - A novel subset of CD4+ TH2 memory/effector cells that produce inflammatory
      IL-17 cytokine and promote the exacerbation of chronic allergic asthma.
AB  - The inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 is involved in the
      pathogenesis of allergic diseases. However, the identity and functions of
      IL-17-producing T cells during the pathogenesis of allergic diseases
      remain unclear. Here, we report a novel subset of T(H)2 memory/effector
      cells that coexpress the transcription factors GATA3 and RORgammat and
      coproduce T(H)17 and T(H)2 cytokines. Classical T(H)2 memory/effector
      cells had the potential to produce IL-17 after stimulation with
      proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-21. The number of
      IL-17-T(H)2 cells was significantly increased in blood of patients with
      atopic asthma. In a mouse model of allergic lung diseases, IL-17-producing
      CD4(+) T(H)2 cells were induced in the inflamed lung and persisted as the
      dominant IL-17-producing T cell population during the chronic stage of
      asthma. Treating cultured bronchial epithelial cells with IL-17 plus T(H)2
      cytokines induced strong up-regulation of chemokine eotaxin-3, Il8, Mip1b,
      and Groa gene expression. Compared with classical T(H)17 and T(H)2 cells,
      antigen-specific IL-17-producing T(H)2 cells induced a profound influx of
      heterogeneous inflammatory leukocytes and exacerbated asthma. Our findings
      highlight the plasticity of T(H)2 memory cells and suggest that
      IL-17-producing T(H)2 cells may represent the key pathogenic T(H)2 cells
      promoting the exacerbation of allergic asthma.

TI  - Potential role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of adult-onset Still's
      disease.
AB  - Objective. To investigate the potential role of Th type 17 (Th17) cells
      and Th17-related cytokines in the pathogenesis of adult-onset Still's
      disease (AOSD). Methods. The frequencies of circulating Th17 cells in 24
      patients with active untreated AOSD, 16 patients with active SLE and 12
      healthy volunteers were determined using intracellular cytokine staining
      and flow cytometry. Serum levels of Th17-related cytokines, including
      IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21 and IL-23 were measured by ELISA.
      Results. Significantly higher median frequencies of circulating Th17 cells
      were found in active untreated AOSD patients (1.01%) and active SLE
      patients (1.26%) than in healthy volunteers (0.12%, both P < 0.001). The
      frequencies of circulating Th17 cells were positively correlated with
      activity score (r = 0.527, P < 0.01) and serum ferritin levels (r = 0.724,
      P < 0.001) in AOSD patients, and correlated with SLEDAI (r = 0.663, P <
      0.01) in SLE patients. Additionally, the frequencies of circulating Th17
      cells were positively and significantly correlated with serum levels of
      IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21 and IL-23 in both AOSD and SLE
      patients. The frequencies of circulating Th17 cells and serum IL-17 levels
      significantly decreased after effective therapy in AOSD patients (both P <
      0.001). Conclusion. Elevated frequencies of circulating Th17 cells and a
      positive correlation with disease activity in our AOSD patients suggest
      that Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.
      Dysregulation of Th17 cells may be a common pathogenic mechanism that
      underlies the development of both AOSD and SLE.

TI  - Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: recent lessons from animal models.
PG  - 1029-35
AB  - Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) may present as a clinically
      heterogeneous group of lupus-specific skin lesions that have common
      histopathological findings. Determination of the immunopathological
      sequence of events in this group of disorders has been challenging for
      dermatologists and immunologists but is vital for therapeutic targeting.
      We review animal models in which different aspects of immune alteration in
      CLE have been addressed. The MRL/lpr mouse develops spontaneous skin
      disease with some features of CLE. Study of this strain and related
      gene-manipulated strains has revealed roles for multiple cytokines,
      including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and IL-21, in disease pathogenesis. A
      role for the growth factor colony stimulating factor 1 and the
      inflammatory protein high-mobility group box 1 has also been suggested. We
      discuss potential novel treatment options suggested by these models.

TI  - Adjuvant treatment suppresses IL-17 production by T cell-independent
      myeloid sources in nonobese diabetic mice.
PG  - 2397-404
AB  - Recent studies have shown that Th17 cells, as a distinct lineage from Th1
      and Th2 subsets, play an obligatory role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune
      diseases. It is well known that immunotherapy with Complete Freund's
      adjuvant (CFA) is effective in preventing from the onset of autoimmune
      diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. In the present study, we
      investigated whether CFA treatment restrained Th17 development and
      down-regulated Th17-related cytokine production in NOD mice. Th17-related
      cytokines (i.e. IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-6, TGF-beta)
      production in splenocytes was decreased dramatically on day 18 following
      CFA immunization. This effect was also observed at 10 and 20 week after
      adjuvant treatment. Injection of IL-17 into CFA-treated diabetes-free mice
      led to occurrence of overt diabetes, indicating that therapeutic effects
      of adjuvant treatment may be partially due to suppressing Th17 commitment.
      Interestingly, the main producer of IL-17 resided in a population of
      myeloid cells, which negatively expressed makers of neutrophil or
      macrophages. IL-23 stimulation did not alter the distribution of IL-17 in
      myeloid cells. Furthermore, this pattern of IL-17 expression was also
      present in Balb/c and C57BL/6 strains. These findings may have important
      implications for understanding of mechanisms underlying adjuvant treatment
      on autoimmune diseases.

TI  - In vivo regulation of Bcl6 and T follicular helper cell development.
PG  - 313-26
AB  - Follicular helper T (T(FH)) cells, defined by expression of the surface
      markers CXCR5 and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and synthesis of
      IL-21, require upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 for
      their development and function in B cell maturation in germinal centers.
      We have explored the role of B cells and the cytokines IL-6 and IL-21 in
      the in vivo regulation of Bcl6 expression and T(FH) cell development. We
      found that T(FH) cells are characterized by a Bcl6-dependent
      downregulation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1, a CCL19- and
      CCL21-binding protein), indicating that, like CXCR5 and PD-1 upregulation,
      modulation of PSGL1 expression is part of the T(FH) cell program of
      differentiation. B cells were neither required for initial upregulation of
      Bcl6 nor PSGL1 downregulation, suggesting these events preceded T-B cell
      interactions, although they were required for full development of the
      T(FH) cell phenotype, including CXCR5 and PD-1 upregulation, and IL-21
      synthesis. Bcl6 upregulation and T(FH) cell differentiation were
      independent of IL-6 and IL-21, revealing that either cytokine is not
      absolutely required for development of Bcl6(+) T(FH) cells in vivo. These
      data increase our understanding of Bcl6 regulation in T(FH) cells and
      their differentiation in vivo and identifies a new surface marker that may
      be functionally relevant in this subset.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of T helper 17 cell differentiation.
PG  - 484-91
AB  - The third lineage of T helper subsets, Th17, has recently been identified
      as an IL- 17-producing CD4+ Th cell, and its functions and regulatory
      mechanisms have been extensively characterized in immune responses.
      Functional studies have provided evidence that Th17 cells are important
      for the modulation of autoimmune responses, such as chronic asthma,
      rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and multiple sclerosis.
      Murine Th17 cell differentiation is enhanced by the coordinated functions
      of distinct cytokines including TGFbeta, IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23, whereas
      IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-27 inhibit its differentiation. In addition,
      Th17 cells are controlled by several transcription factors such as
      RORgammat, IRF4, BATF, FoxP3, T-bet, PPARgamma, E-FABP, and SOCSs. This
      review focuses on the functions and regulatory mechanisms of several
      transcription factors in the control of Th17 cell differentiation.

TI  - TGF-beta induces IL-9 production from human Th17 cells.
PG  - 46-54
AB  - The secretion of IL-9, initially recognized as a Th2 cytokine, was
      recently attributed to a novel CD4 T cell subset termed Th9 in the murine
      system. However, IL-9 can also be secreted by mouse Th17 cells and may
      mediate aspects of the proinflammatory activities of Th17 cells. Here we
      report that IL-9 is secreted by human naive CD4 T cells in response to
      differentiation by Th9 (TGF-beta and IL-4) or Th17 polarizing conditions.
      Yet, these differentiated naive cells did not coexpress IL-17 and IL-9,
      unless they were repeatedly stimulated under Th17 differentiation-inducing
      conditions. In contrast to the naive cells, memory CD4 T cells were
      induced to secrete IL-9 by simply providing TGF-beta during stimulation,
      as neither IL-4 nor proinflammatory cytokines were required. Furthermore,
      the addition of TGF-beta to the Th17-inducing cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6,
      IL-21, IL-23) that induce memory cells to secrete IL-17, resulted in the
      marked coexpression of IL-9 in IL-17 producing memory cells. The
      proinflammatory cytokine mediating TGF-beta-dependent coexpression of IL-9
      and IL-17 was identified to be IL-1beta. Moreover, circulating monocytes
      were potent costimulators of IL-9 production by Th17 cells via their
      capacity to secrete IL-1beta. Finally, to determine whether IL-9/IL-17
      coproducing CD4 cells were altered in an inflammatory condition, we
      examined patients with autoimmune diabetes and demonstrated that these
      subjects exhibit a higher frequency of memory CD4 cells with the capacity
      to transition into IL-9(+)IL-17(+) cells. These data demonstrate the
      presence of IL-17(+)IL-9(+) CD4 cells induced by IL-1beta that may play a
      role in human autoimmune disease.

TI  - Downregulation of Th17 cells in the small intestine by disruption of gut
      flora in the absence of retinoic acid.
PG  - 6799-806
AB  - Retinoic acid (RA), a well-known vitamin A metabolite, mediates inhibition
      of the IL-6-driven induction of proinflammatory Th17 cells and promotes
      anti-inflammatory regulatory T cell generation in the presence of
      TGF-beta, which is mainly regulated by dendritic cells. To directly
      address the role of RA in Th17/regulatory T cell generation in vivo, we
      generated vitamin A-deficient (VAD) mice by continuous feeding of a VAD
      diet beginning in gestation. We found that a VAD diet resulted in
      significant inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation in the small intestine
      lamina propria by as early as age 5 wk. Furthermore, this diet resulted in
      low mRNA expression levels of IL-17, IFN regulatory factor 4, IL-21,
      IL-22, and IL-23 without alteration of other genes, such as RORgammat,
      TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-25, and IL-27 in the small intestine ileum. In vitro
      results of enhanced Th17 induction by VAD dendritic cells did not mirror
      in vivo results, suggesting the existence of other regulation factors.
      Interestingly, the VAD diet elicited high levels of mucin MUC2 by goblet
      cell hyperplasia and subsequently reduced gut microbiome, including
      segmented filamentous bacteria. Much like wild-type mice, the VAD diet-fed
      MyD88-/-TRIF-/- mice had significantly fewer IL-17-secreting CD4+ T cells
      than the control diet-fed MyD88-/-TRIF-/- mice. The results strongly
      suggest that RA deficiency altered gut microbiome, which in turn inhibited
      Th17 differentiation in the small intestine lamina propria.

TI  - Regulation of human Th9 differentiation by type I interferons and IL-21.
PG  - 624-31
AB  - Interleukin (IL)-9-producing CD4(+) T cells are a novel subset of T helper
      (Th) cells that develops independently of the Th1, Th2, Th17 and
      regulatory T-cell lineages. Similar to the murine model, transforming
      growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-4 directed human naive CD4(+) T cells to
      produce IL-9. Whereas IL-4 suppressed TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 expression,
      TGF-beta failed to inhibit IL-4-mediated upregulation of the Th2
      transcription factor GATA-3. Addition of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10,
      interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta or IL-21 to Th9-polarizing conditions
      augmented Th9 differentiation, while the Th1-associated cytokines
      IFN-gamma and IL-27 partially suppressed IL-9 production. Given that T
      cells are a primary source of IL-21, IL-21 expression was analyzed under
      Th9-polarizing conditions in the context of inflammatory cytokines.
      Surprisingly, type I IFNs induced elevated levels of IL-21, and blockade
      of IL-21 abrogated their ability to enhance Th9 differentiation. Taken
      together, these data indicate a complex cytokine network in the regulation
      of human IL-9-producing CD4(+) T cells.

TI  - Elevated IL-17 produced by TH17 cells promotes myeloma cell growth and
      inhibits immune function in multiple myeloma.
PG  - 5385-92
AB  - Elevated cytokines in bone marrow (BM) micro-environment (interleukin-6
      [IL-6], transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-beta], and IL-1beta) may play
      an important role in observed immune dysfunction in multiple myeloma (MM).
      As IL-6 and TGF-beta are important for the generation of T-helper 17
      (T(H)17) cells, we evaluated and observed a significantly elevated
      baseline and induced frequency of T(h)17 cells in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and BM mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from MM
      patients compared with healthy donors. We observed significant increase in
      levels of serum IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23 in blood and BM in MM
      compared with healthy donors. We also observed that myeloma PBMCs after
      T(H)17 polarization significantly induced IL-1alpha, IL-13, IL-17, and
      IL-23 production compared with healthy donor PBMCs. We next observed that
      IL-17 promotes myeloma cell growth and colony formation via IL-17
      receptor, adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as well as
      increased growth in vivo in murine xenograft model of human MM.
      Additionally, we have observed that combination of IL-17 and IL-22
      significantly inhibited the production of T(H)1-mediated cytokines,
      including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), by healthy donor PBMCs. In
      conclusion, IL-17-producing T(h)17 cells play an important role in MM
      pathobiology and may be an important therapeutic target for anti-MM
      activity and to improve immune function.

TI  - Unregulated IL-23/IL-17 immune response in autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 222-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 1A diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting
      from the selective destruction of pancreatic beta cells by T cells most
      likely due to interaction of environmental and genetic factors. The CD4(+)
      T cells, largely implicated in this disease, comprise different subsets;
      based on the cytokines they produce. These subsets include Th1, Th2,
      regulatory T cells and another population of recently described T cells
      called Th17 cells. Increased expression of interleukin 17 (IL-17) has been
      detected in sera and in target tissues of patients with various autoimmune
      diseases. The differentiation of Th17 cells from naive T cells appears to
      involve signals from TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-21, IL-1beta and IL-23. IL-23, a
      member of the IL-12 family, which activate the effector function of Th17
      cells to promote inflammatory responses. In animal models, IL-23 is
      involved in the development of autoimmune diabetes. In humans, it seems to
      cause multi-organ inflammation, contributing to rheumatoid arthritis,
      inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease manifestations. CONCLUSIONS:
      The discovery that certain autoimmune disorders might be largely mediated
      by an unregulated IL-23/IL-17 response has important implications for the
      development of novel therapies for these diseases.

TI  - A fusion of GMCSF and IL-21 initiates hypersignaling through the
      IL-21Ralpha chain with immune activating and tumoricidal effects in vivo.
PG  - 1293-301
AB  - We hypothesized that fusing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulation
      factor (GMCSF) and interleukin (IL)-21 as a single bifunctional cytokine
      (hereafter GIFT-21) would lead to synergistic anticancer immune effects
      because of their respective roles in mediating inflammation. Mechanistic
      analysis of GIFT-21 found that it leads to IL-21Ralpha-dependent STAT3
      hyperactivation while also contemporaneously behaving as a
      dominant-negative inhibitor of GMCSF-driven STAT5 activation. GIFT-21's
      aberrant interactions with its cognate receptors on macrophages resulted
      in production of 30-fold greater amounts of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and MCP-1
      when compared to controls. Furthermore, GIFT-21 treatment of primary B and
      T lymphocytes leads to STAT1-dependent apoptosis of IL-21Ralpha(+)
      lymphocytes. B16 melanoma cells gene-enhanced to produce GIFT-21 were
      immune rejected by syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice comparable to the effect of
      IL-21 alone. However, a significant GIFT-21-driven survival advantage was
      seen when NOD-SCID mice were implanted with GIFT-21-secreting B16 cells,
      consistent with a meaningful role of macrophages in tumor rejection.
      Because GIFT-21 leads to apoptosis of IL-21Ralpha(+) lymphocytes, we
      tested its cytolytic effect on IL-21Ralpha(+) EL-4 lymphoma tumors
      implanted in C57Bl/6 mice and could demonstrate a significant increase in
      survival. These data indicate that GIFT-21 is a novel IL-21Ralpha agonist
      that co-opts IL-21Ralpha-dependent signaling in a manner permissive for
      targeted cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Dysregulated balance of Th17 and Th1 cells in systemic lupus
      erythematosus.
PG  - R53
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interleukin (IL)-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is
      produced largely by a unique CD4(+) T-helper (Th) subset called Th17
      cells. The development of Th17 cells is suppressed by interferon
      (IFN)-gamma produced by Th1 cells, suggesting cross-regulation between
      Th17 and Th1 cells. Thus, this study analyzed the balance of CD4+ Th17 and
      Th1 cell responses in peripheral blood from patients with systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) and healthy subjects. METHODS: Twenty-five adult
      patients with SLE and 26 healthy subjects matched for gender and age (+/-
      2 years) were recruited. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
      patients and healthy subjects were stimulated for 4 h ex vivo with phorbol
      myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. The frequency of CD4(+) T cells
      producing IL-17 and/or IFN-gamma was measured by using flow cytometry.
      Expression of Th17-associated chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR6 on CD4(+)
      T cells as well as plasma levels of Th17-polarizing cytokines were
      assessed. Disease activity was evaluated by the SLE disease activity index
      score (SLEDAI). Unpaired t test and Pearson correlation were used for
      statistical analyses. RESULTS: Patients with SLE had an increased
      frequency of CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells compared with healthy subjects.
      However, the frequency of CD4(+)IFN-gamma(+) T cells was similar between
      the two groups, indicating an altered balance of Th17 and Th1 cell
      responses in SLE. Patients with SLE also had an increased frequency of
      CD4(+)CCR4(+)CCR6(+) T cells that are known to produce IL-17. The
      frequency of CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells and CD4(+)CCR4(+)CCR6+ T cells
      correlated with disease activity. In measuring plasma levels of the
      Th17-polarizing cytokines, levels of IL-6 were higher in patients with SLE
      than in healthy subjects, although levels of IL-1beta, IL-21, IL-23, and
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta were not different between the two
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate an enhanced Th17 cell response that
      correlates with disease activity in patients with SLE, suggesting a role
      for IL-17 in the pathogenesis of lupus. Our data indicate that the
      mechanisms involved in balancing Th1 and Th17 regulation, as well as in
      producing IL-6, are aberrant in SLE, leading to an increased Th17
      response. We suggest that CCR4 and CCR6 expression on CD4(+) T cells
      should be considered as markers of disease activity, and that IL-17
      blocking may offer a therapeutic target in SLE.

TI  - Interleukin-23 promotes Th17 differentiation by inhibiting T-bet and FoxP3
      and is required for elevation of interleukin-22, but not interleukin-21,
      in autoimmune experimental arthritis.
PG  - 1043-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of interleukin-23 (IL-23) in subgroup
      polarization of IL-17A-positive and/or interferon-gamma
      (IFNgamma)-positive T cells in autoimmune disease-prone DBA/1 mice with
      and without collagen-induced arthritis. METHODS: A magnetic-activated cell
      sorting system was used to isolate CD4+ T cells from the spleen of naive
      and type II collagen (CII)-immunized DBA/1 mice. These CD4+ T cells were
      stimulated in vitro under Th0, Th1, or different Th17 culture conditions.
      Intracellular staining for IL-17A and IFNgamma was evaluated by flow
      cytometry. In addition, Th17 cytokines and T helper-specific transcription
      factors were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In CD4+ T cells from
      naive DBA/1 mice, IL-23 alone hardly induced retinoic acid-related orphan
      receptor gammat (RORgammat), Th17 polarization, and Th17 cytokines, but it
      inhibited T-bet expression. In contrast, transforming growth factor beta1
      (TGFbeta1)/IL-6 was a potent inducer of RORgammat, RORalpha, IL-17A,
      IL-17F, IL-21, and FoxP3 in these cells. In contrast to TGFbeta1/IL-6,
      IL-23 was critical for the induction of IL-22 in CD4+ T cells from both
      naive and CII-immunized DBA/1 mice. Consistent with these findings, IL-23
      showed a more pronounced induction of the IL-17A+IFNgamma- subset in CD4+
      T cells from CII-immunized mice. However, in CD4+ T cells from naive mice,
      IL-23 significantly increased the TGFbeta1/IL-6-induced Th17 polarization,
      including elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F and decreased expression of
      T-bet and FoxP3. Of note, the IL-23-induced increase in IL-17A and IL-17F
      levels was prevented in T-bet-deficient mice. CONCLUSION: IL-23 promotes
      Th17 differentiation by inhibiting T-bet and FoxP3 and is required for
      elevation of IL-22, but not IL-21, levels in autoimmune arthritis. These
      data indicate different mechanisms for IL-23 and TGFbeta1/IL-6 at the
      transcription factor level during Th17 differentiation in autoimmune
      experimental arthritis.

TI  - Autoantibodies against IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 in patients with chronic
      mucocutaneous candidiasis and autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I.
PG  - 291-7
AB  - Most patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS-I)
      display chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). We hypothesized that this
      CMC might result from autoimmunity to interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines. We
      found high titers of autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against IL-17A, IL-17F,
      and/or IL-22 in the sera of all 33 patients tested, as detected by
      multiplex particle-based flow cytometry. The auto-Abs against IL-17A,
      IL-17F, and IL-22 were specific in the five patients tested, as shown by
      Western blotting. The auto-Abs against IL-17A were neutralizing in the
      only patient tested, as shown by bioassays of IL-17A activity. None of the
      37 healthy controls and none of the 103 patients with other autoimmune
      disorders tested had such auto-Abs. None of the patients with APS-I had
      auto-Abs against cytokines previously shown to cause other well-defined
      clinical syndromes in other patients (IL-6, interferon [IFN]-gamma, or
      granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) or against other
      cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-21, IL-23, IL-26, IFN-beta,
      tumor necrosis factor [alpha], or transforming growth factor beta). These
      findings suggest that auto-Abs against IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 may cause
      CMC in patients with APS-I.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha blockade exacerbates murine psoriasis-like
      disease by enhancing Th17 function and decreasing expansion of Treg cells.
PG  - 430-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis respond well to
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) blockers in general; however, there
      is now mounting evidence that a small cohort of patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis who receive TNFalpha blockers develop psoriasis. This study was
      undertaken to explore the mechanisms underlying TNFalpha blockade-induced
      exacerbation of skin inflammation in murine psoriasis-like skin disease.
      METHODS: Skin inflammation was induced in BALB/c scid/scid mice after they
      received CD4+CD45RB(high)CD25- (naive CD4) T cells from donor mice. These
      mice were treated with either anti-interleukin-12 (anti-IL-12)/23p40
      antibody or murine TNFRII-Fc fusion protein and were examined for signs of
      disease, including histologic features, various cytokine levels in the
      serum, and cytokine or FoxP3 transcripts in the affected skin and draining
      lymph node (LN) cells. In a separate study, naive CD4+ T cells were
      differentiated into Th1 or Th17 lineages with anti-CD3/28 magnetic beads
      and appropriate cytokines in the presence or absence of TNFalpha. Cytokine
      gene expression from these differentiated cells was also determined.
      RESULTS: Neutralization of TNFalpha exacerbated skin inflammation and
      markedly enhanced the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines
      IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 but suppressed FoxP3 expression in
      the skin and reduced the number of FoxP3-positive Treg cells in the
      draining LNs. TNFalpha also demonstrated a divergent role during priming
      and reactivation of naive T cells. CONCLUSION: These results reveal a
      novel immunoregulatory role of TNFalpha on Th17 and Treg cells in some
      individuals, which may account for the exacerbation of skin inflammation
      in some patients who receive anti-TNF treatments.

TI  - Signals that influence T follicular helper cell differentiation and
      function.
PG  - 183-96
AB  - Follicular helper T cells have recently emerged as a separate CD4(+) T
      helper lineage specialised in provision of help to B cells. They develop
      independently from Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells and are critical for humoral
      immunity, including the generation of long-lived and high affinity plasma
      cells and memory cells crucial for long-term protection against
      infections. A stepwise differentiation programme has emerged in which T
      cell receptor (TCR) signalling strength, CD28-mediated costimulation, B
      cell-derived inducible costimulator ligand signals, induction of c-maf and
      actions of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-21, lead to
      upregulation of the transcriptional repressor B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6)
      that drives T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation. Bcl-6 turns on
      a repression programme that targets Blimp-1, transcriptional regulators of
      other helper lineages and microRNAs. Their concerted actions modulate
      expression of chemokine receptors, surface molecules and cytokines
      critical for follicular homing and B cell helper functions. Here, we
      review the nature of Tfh cells providing help to B cells during the two
      phases of B cell activation that occur in the outer T zone and, for some B
      cells, in germinal centres (GC). Recent insights into the signalling
      events that drive terminal differentiation of Tfh cells critical for
      selecting somatically mutated GC B cells and the consequences of Tfh
      dysregulation for immunodeficiency and autoimmune pathology are discussed.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 6 drives interleukin-17A expression during experimental
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
PG  - 125-36
AB  - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a T-cell-driven disease that is
      histologically characterized by diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrates and
      loosely formed granulomas in the lungs. We have previously reported that
      interleukin-17A (IL-17A) contributes to the development of experimental
      HP, and that the pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6)
      might be a factor in the initiation of this response. Using a
      well-established murine model of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula-induced
      HP, we investigated the role of TLR6 in the immunopathogenesis of this
      disease. In the absence of TLR6 signalling, mice that received multiple
      challenges with S. rectivirgula-antigen (SR-Ag) had significantly less
      lung inflammation compared with C57BL/6 mice (wild-type; WT) similarly
      challenged with SR-Ag. Flow cytometric analysis of whole lung samples from
      SR-Ag-challenged mice showed that TLR6(-/-) mice had a decreased CD4(+) :
      CD8(+) T-cell ratio compared with WT mice. Cytokine analysis at various
      days after the final SR-Ag challenge revealed that whole lungs from
      TLR6(-/-) mice contained significantly less IL-17A than lungs from WT mice
      with HP. The IL-17A-driving cytokines IL-21 and IL-23 were also expressed
      at lower levels in SR-Ag-challenged TLR6(-/-) mice, when compared with
      SR-Ag-challenged WT mice. Other pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely
      interferon-gamma and RANTES, were also found to be regulated by TLR6
      signalling. Anti-TLR6 neutralizing antibody treatment of dispersed lung
      cells significantly impaired SR-Ag-induced IL-17A and IL-6 generation.
      Together, these results indicate that TLR6 plays a pivotal role in the
      development and severity of HP via its role in IL-17A production.

TI  - IL-7 receptor is expressed on adult pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia and other B-cell derived neoplasms and correlates with expression
      of proliferation and survival markers.
PG  - 58-68
AB  - The interleukin (IL)-7 receptor (IL-7R) is expressed on human pre-B but
      not mature B-cells. We hypothesised that aberrant expression of IL-7R
      contributes to B-cell oncogenesis. Surface expression of IL-7R components
      CD127 and CD132, and intracellular Ki-67 and Bcl-2 were examined by flow
      cytometry on peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells (PBMC;
      BMMC) from patients with B-cell derived neoplasms, chronic human
      immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection alone, or healthy
      volunteers. Plasma IL-7, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-21, TNF-alpha,
      IFN-gamma and BAFF were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay or
      bead array. The effects of exogenous IL-7 on PBMC and BMMC were examined.
      CD127 expression was elevated in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (pre-B-ALL) and in some cases of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL). Plasma
      IL-7 levels were higher in pre-B-ALL, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (B-CLL) and HIV-1 associated B-NHL (HIV-B-NHL) compared with control
      groups. CD127+ pre-B-ALL cells had higher expression of Ki-67, Bcl-2 and
      CD132 than CD127- counterparts. Unlike T-lineage cells, CD127+ pre-B-ALL
      cells did not down-regulate CD127 in response to exogenous IL-7. Patients
      with B-cell derived neoplasms had elevated circulating IL-10 and decreased
      BAFF. These findings support a role for the IL-7/IL-7R system in B-cell
      oncogenesis.

TI  - T helper 17 cells: discovery, function, and physiological trigger.
PG  - 1407-21
AB  - In the few years since their discovery, T helper 17 cells (T(H)17) have
      been shown to play an important role in host defense against infections,
      and in tissue inflammation during autoimmunity. T(H)17 cells produce
      IL-17, IL-21, IL-10, and IL-22 cytokines, and thus have broad effects on a
      variety of tissues. Notably, the requirement for the immunosuppressive
      cytokine TGF-beta along with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 for T(H)17
      differentiation supports the intimate relationship between the T(H)17
      subset and FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells. Here, we discuss current knowledge
      on effector functions and differentiation of the T(H)17 lineage.
      Furthermore, we now know of a physiological stimulus for T(H)17
      differentiation: innate immune recognition of cells undergoing apoptosis
      as a direct result of infection induces unique development of this subset.
      As our knowledge of T(H)17 and T regulatory cells grows, we are building
      on a new framework for the understanding of effector T cell
      differentiation and the biology of CD4(+) T cell adaptive immune
      responses.

TI  - c-Maf activates the promoter and enhancer of the IL-21 gene, and TGF-beta
      inhibits c-Maf-induced IL-21 production in CD4+ T cells.
PG  - 703-12
AB  - Previous studies have shown that IL-6 potently induces IL-21 production in
      CD4(+) T cells, whereas TGF-beta inhibits IL-6-induced IL-21 production in
      CD4(+) T cells. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms underlying the
      transcriptional regulation of IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells. We found
      that IL-6 induced c-Maf expression in CD4(+) T cells and that the enforced
      expression of c-Maf induced IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells without
      IL-6, IL-4/STAT6 signaling, or an autocrine effect of IL-21. Moreover, we
      found that c-Maf directly bound to and activated IL-21P and the CNS-2
      enhancer through MARE sites. On the other hand, we also found that
      although TGF-beta up-regulated IL-6-induced c-Maf expression in CD4(+) T
      cells, TGF-beta inhibited c-Maf-induced IL-21 production in CD4(+) T
      cells. Finally, we found that Foxp3 bound to IL-21P and the CNS-2 enhancer
      and inhibited c-Maf-induced IL-21 production modestly but significantly in
      CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that c-Maf induces
      IL-21 production directly in CD4(+) T cells by activating IL-21P and the
      CNS-2 enhancer and that TGF-beta suppresses c-Maf-induced IL-21 production
      in CD4(+) T cells.

TI  - C5a receptor-deficient dendritic cells promote induction of Treg and Th17
      cells.
PG  - 710-21
AB  - C5a is a proinflammatory mediator that has recently been shown to regulate
      adaptive immune responses. Here we demonstrate that C5a receptor (C5aR)
      signaling in DC affects the development of Treg and Th17 cells. Genetic
      ablation or pharmacological targeting of the C5aR in spleen-derived DC
      results in increased production of TGF-beta leading to de novo
      differentiation of Foxp3(+) Treg within 12 h after co-incubation with
      CD4(+) T cells from DO11.10/RAG2(-/-) mice. Stimulation of C5aR(-/-) DC
      with OVA and TLR2 ligand Pam(3)CSK(4) increased TGF-beta production and
      induced high levels of IL-6 and IL-23 but only minor amounts of IL-12
      leading to differentiation of Th cells producing IL-17A and IL-21. Th17
      differentiation was also found in vivo after adoptive transfer of CD4(+)
      Th cell into C5aR(-/-) mice immunized with OVA and Pam(3)CSK(4). The
      altered cytokine production of C5aR(-/-) DC was associated with low steady
      state MHC class II expression and an impaired ability to upregulate CD86
      and CD40 in response to TLR2. Our data suggest critical roles for C5aR in
      Treg and Th17-cell differentiation through regulation of DC function.

TI  - Age-related T-cell cytokine profile parallels corneal disease severity in
      Sjogren's syndrome-like keratoconjunctivitis sicca in CD25KO mice.
PG  - 246-58
AB  - OBJECTIVES: IL-2ralpha (CD25)(-/-) mice develop autoimmunity and
      lymphoproliferative disorders, including SS-like disease. The objective of
      this study was to evaluate the severity of corneal epithelial disease and
      T-cell cytokine profile in the ocular surface tissues of CD25KO mice.
      METHODS: CD25KO mice were evaluated at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Corneal
      epithelial smoothness and corneal permeability were measured. Phenotype of
      infiltrating lymphocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Th-1, -2
      and -17 associated factors were measured by real-time PCR in cornea and
      conjunctiva and by Luminex immunobead assay in tears. RESULTS: Compared
      with 8-week-old wild-type (WT) mice, CD25KO mice of the same age had
      significantly greater corneal irregularity and a significant increase in
      the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells infiltrating the conjunctiva.
      CD25KO mice had significantly higher levels of IL-6, TGF-beta1, IL-23R,
      IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, CCL20, IL-10, GATA-3 and IFN-gamma mRNA transcripts
      in their cornea and conjunctiva than WT mice at 8 weeks. IL-17A and IL-17F
      mRNA transcripts peaked at 12 weeks, whereas IFN-gamma spiked at 16 weeks
      in CD25KO mice. Increased expression of IL-17A and IL-17F at 12 weeks in
      CD25KO mice was accompanied by a worsening of corneal surface parameters
      and an increase of CD4(+) T cell infiltrating the cornea. CONCLUSIONS:
      Disruption of IL-2 signalling in CD25KO mice results in age-dependent
      SS-like autoimmune lacrimal-keratoconjunctivitis. A mix of Th-1 and Th-17
      cytokines was detected. The peak severity of corneal epithelial disease

TI  - [Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis]
PG  - 492-501
AB  - Th17 cells are a recently described subset of T helper lymphocytes
      characterized by the production of IL-17 (IL-17A). Since their discovery
      in 2003, studies on Th17 cells have become increasingly popular among
      immunologists and they have emerged as key players in the pathogenesis of
      multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune disorders traditionally
      attributed to Th1 cells. Murine Th17 lymphocytes differentiate from naive
      CD4+ cells in a specific cytokine environment, which includes TGF-b and
      IL-6 or IL-21, whereas human Th17 cell development requires TGF-beta,
      IL-1b, and IL-2 in combination with IL-6, IL-21, or IL-23. Th17-related
      response is additionally enhanced by osteopontin, TNFalpha, and PGE2 and
      suppressed by IL-25, IL-27, IL-35, and IL-10. Apart from their main
      cytokine, Th17 cells can also express IL-17F, IL-21,IL-22, TNFalpha,
      CCL20, and, in humans, IL-26. All of these mediators may contribute to the
      proinflammatory action of Th17 cells both in the clearance of various
      pathogens and in autoimmunity. At least some of these functions are
      exerted through the induction of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines (CXCL1,
      CXCL2, CXCL8) by IL-17. Accumulating evidence from studies on mice and
      humans indicates an important role of Th17 cells in mediating autoimmune
      neuroinflammation. This has led some immunologists to question the
      previously exhibited importance of Th1 cells in MS pathology. However,
      more recent data suggest that both these T-cell subsets are capable of
      inducing and promoting the disease. Further investigation is required to
      clarify the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of MS since some of the
      Th17-related molecules appear as attractive targets for future therapeutic
      strategies.

TI  - Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, Th17 effector cells, and cytokine environment
      in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 80-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to result from an
      aberrant immune response. Inflammation in IBD may be caused by the loss of
      homeostasis between CD4+ CD25high Foxp3+ regulatory cells (Treg) and
      proinflammatory Th17 cells. The aim of this study was to investigate Treg
      and Th17 cells in the peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa of IBD
      patients and to assess the mucosal cytokine environment. METHODS: Treg and
      Th17 cells were measured in peripheral blood of 63 IBD patients and 28
      controls by flow cytometry. Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3), interleukin (IL)-17a,
      IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
      mRNA were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction in intestinal biopsies of 24 IBD and 18 control subjects.
      RESULTS: A decrease in Treg and increase in Th17 cells was observed in the
      peripheral blood of IBD patients. When measured in the same patient and
      expressed as a ratio, a significant decrease in Treg/Th17 ratio was
      observed in IBD. Elevated expression of Foxp3, IL-17a, IL-1beta, and IL-6
      was observed in the mucosa of IBD patients, while TGF-beta was only
      elevated in ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: IBD is associated with a
      reduced ratio of Treg to Th17 cells in peripheral blood and is
      characterized by a proinflammatory cytokine microenvironment, which
      supports the continued generation of Th17 cells.

TI  - Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite induce gene expression of interleukin
      receptors increasing IL-21, IL-7, IL-1 and oncostatin M in cardiomyocytes.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - AIM: The objective of this investigation was to determine whether nitric
      oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite alter the gene expression of interleukin
      receptors (IL-R) in cardiomyocytes. MAIN METHODS: Cardiomyocytes, from
      neonatal mouse heart, in culture were treated with the NO donor
      3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1), which releases NO and
      peroxynitrite. IL-R gene expression was assessed by microarray analysis.
      KEY FINDINGS: Gene expression data show that the IL-2 receptor family
      showed a highly significant and 1.7-fold increase in the gamma chain
      component which is common to all members of the IL-2 family receptors.
      There was a significant and 2-fold increase in IL-21 R and an increase of
      1.8-fold in IL-7 Ralpha gene expression. In contrast there was a
      significant 0.7-fold decrease in IL-9 Ralpha. The IL-1 receptor family
      showed a significant and 1.4-fold increase in IL-1 R1 compared to control
      but no change in IL-18 R1 gene expression which was similar to control.
      The IL-6 family showed a significant increase in oncostatin M receptor
      gene expression of 1.3-fold but no change in IL-6 R alpha or IL-11 R
      alpha. SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that NO/peroxynitrite by
      increasing gene expression of certain IL-Rs may magnify the effects of
      specific interleukins in conditions of excess interleukin production.

TI  - Regulatory and pro-inflammatory phenotypes of myelin basic
      protein-autoreactive T cells in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1329-40
AB  - MBP-specific autoreactive T cells are considered pro-inflammatory T cells
      and thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple
      sclerosis (MS). Here, we report that MBP(83-99)-specific T cells generated
      from MS patients (n = 7) were comprised of pro-inflammatory and regulatory
      subsets of distinct phenotypes. The pro-inflammatory phenotype was
      characterized by high production of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-17 and
      low expression of FOXP3, whereas the regulatory subset expressed high
      levels of FOXP3 and exhibited potent regulatory functions. The regulatory
      subset of MBP-specific T cells appeared to expand from the CD4(+)CD25(-)
      T-cell pool. Their FOXP3 expression was stable, independent of the
      activation state and it correlated with suppressive function and inversely
      with the production of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-17. In contrast, the
      phenotype and function of FOXP3(low) MBP-specific T cells were adaptive
      and dependent on IL-6. The higher frequency of FOXP3(high) MBP-specific T
      cells was observed when IL-6 was neutralized in the culture of PBMC with
      MBP. The study provides new evidence that MBP-specific T cells are
      susceptible to pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu and act as either
      pro-inflammatory or regulatory T cells.

TI  - The nuclear receptor PPAR gamma selectively inhibits Th17 differentiation
      in a T cell-intrinsic fashion and suppresses CNS autoimmunity.
PG  - 2079-89
AB  - T helper cells secreting interleukin (IL)-17 (Th17 cells) play a crucial
      role in autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). Th17
      differentiation, which is induced by a combination of transforming growth
      factor (TGF)-beta/IL-6 or IL-21, requires expression of the transcription
      factor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR gamma
      t). We identify the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) as a key negative regulator of human and mouse
      Th17 differentiation. PPAR gamma activation in CD4(+) T cells selectively
      suppressed Th17 differentiation, but not differentiation into Th1, Th2, or
      regulatory T cells. Control of Th17 differentiation by PPAR gamma involved
      inhibition of TGF-beta/IL-6-induced expression of ROR gamma t in T cells.
      Pharmacologic activation of PPAR gamma prevented removal of the silencing
      mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors corepressor from the
      ROR gamma t promoter in T cells, thus interfering with ROR gamma t
      transcription. Both T cell-specific PPAR gamma knockout and endogenous
      ligand activation revealed the physiological role of PPAR gamma for
      continuous T cell-intrinsic control of Th17 differentiation and
      development of autoimmunity. Importantly, human CD4(+) T cells from
      healthy controls and MS patients were strongly susceptible to PPAR
      gamma-mediated suppression of Th17 differentiation. In summary, we report
      a PPAR gamma-mediated T cell-intrinsic molecular mechanism that
      selectively controls Th17 differentiation in mice and in humans and that
      is amenable to pharmacologic modulation. We therefore propose that PPAR
      gamma represents a promising molecular target for specific
      immunointervention in Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS.

TI  - Early commitment of naive human CD4(+) T cells to the T follicular helper
      (T(FH)) cell lineage is induced by IL-12.
PG  - 590-600
AB  - T follicular helper (T(FH)) cells are a specialized subset of CD4(+) T
      cells that localize to B-cell follicles, where they are positioned to
      provide help for the induction of optimal humoral immune responses. Key
      features of T(FH) cells are the expressions of CXCR5, ICOS, interleukin
      (IL)-21 and BCL-6. The requirements for human T(FH) cell development are
      unknown. Here we show that IL-6, IL-12, IL-21 and IL-23 are capable of
      inducing IL-21 expression in naive CD4(+) T cells isolated from human
      tonsils, peripheral blood and cord blood. However, only IL-12 induced
      sustained expressions of CXCR5 and ICOS on these activated naive CD4(+) T
      cells, and endowed them with the ability to provide increased help to B
      cells for their differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. The
      effects of IL-12 were independent of interferon-gamma and T-bet, and
      associated with upregulation of BCL-6 expression. Thus, these cytokines,
      particularly IL-12, are likely to act at an early stage during dendritic
      cell-mediated priming of naive CD4(+) T cells into a T(FH) cell fate, and
      thus underpin antibody-mediated immunity.

TI  - The effector T helper cell triade.
PG  - 61-74
AB  - T lymphocytes play crucial role in immune responses. Effector T helper
      (Th) cells derive from progenitor naive CD4+ T cells, after maturational
      process induced by antigenic stimulation. Their commitment depends on
      complex interactions with antigen-presenting cells in a permissive milieu,
      including antigenic type and load, costimulatory molecules and cytokine
      signaling. Committed CD4+ T cells may differentiate into Th1, Th2, TH17
      phenotypes (the effector Th cell triade), with distinct cytokine products
      and biological functions, or evolve into the inducible regulatory T (Treg)
      lineage, with immunomodulatory functions. Th1 subset, primarily addressed
      to face intracellular pathogens, produces interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3,
      interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-beta, peculiarly supporting
      cellular immunity. Th2 cells, essential in eliminating extracellular
      pathogens, including helminthes, express IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13,
      and IL-25, supporting humoral immunity. Th17 subset, determinant in
      fighting Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and some protozoa, secretes IL-17,
      IL-21, and IL-22, with strong proinflammatory effects. Th responses are
      tightly controlled to avoid self antigen reactivity or excessive reactions
      to non-self antigens. In fact, dysregulated Th1 response drives
      cell-mediated autoimmune disorders, and enhanced Th2 activity is involved
      in atopy, whereas Th17 cells are probably responsible for chronic tissue
      inflammation. Skewing of response away from Treg cells may lead to the
      onset and/or progression of autoimmune diseases or acute transplant
      rejection in humans. A better understanding of Th triade functions, and a
      clearer definition of Th response regulatory mechanisms may provide novel
      therapeutic opportunities in treating immunopathologies.

TI  - Stage dependent aberrant regulation of cytokine-STAT signaling in murine
      systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - e6756
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease of
      unknown etiology that involves multiple interacting cell types driven by
      numerous cytokines and autoimmune epitopes. Although the initiating events
      leading to SLE pathology are not understood, there is a growing
      realization that dysregulated cytokine action on immune cells plays an
      important role in promoting the inflammatory autoimmune state. We applied
      phospho-specific flow cytometry to characterize the extent to which
      regulation of cytokine signal transduction through the STAT family of
      transcription factors is disturbed during the progression of SLE. Using a
      panel of 10 cytokines thought to have causal roles in the disease, we
      measured signaling responses at the single-cell level in five immune cell
      types from the MRLlpr murine model. This generated a highly multiplexed
      view of how cytokine stimuli are processed by intracellular signaling
      networks in adaptive and innate immune cells during different stages of
      SLE pathogenesis. We report that robust changes in cytokine signal
      transduction occur during the progression of SLE in multiple immune cell
      subtypes including increased T cell responsiveness to IL-10 and ablation
      of Stat1 responses to IFNalpha, IFNgamma, IL-6, and IL-21, Stat3 responses
      to IL-6, Stat5 responses to IL-15, and Stat6 responses to IL-4. We found
      increased intracellular expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1
      protein correlated with negative regulation of Stat1 responses to
      inflammatory cytokines. The results provide evidence of negative feedback
      regulation opposing inflammatory cytokines that have self-sustaining
      activities and suggest a cytokine-driven oscillator circuit may drive the
      periodic disease activity observed in many SLE patients.

TI  - Multiparametric analysis of cytokine-driven human Th17 differentiation
      reveals a differential regulation of IL-17 and IL-22 production.
PG  - 3610-4
AB  - T helper 17 (Th17) cells produce IL-17 but can also make tumor necrosis
      factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-21, and IL-22. These cytokines
      collectively contribute to the functional outcome of the Th response.
      IL-22 plays a critical role in some Th17-associated diseases, such as
      psoriasis, but its relationship to IL-17 remains controversial. Here, we
      used a systematic multiparametric analysis of Th-17-associated cytokines,
      which revealed the unexpected finding that the regulation pattern of IL-22
      was most closely related to interferon-gamma, the prototypical Th1
      cytokine, and not to IL-17. To explain this observation, we systematically
      tested the role of Th1- and Th17-inducing cytokines. We could show that
      IL-12 and IL-23 induced high levels of IL-22 but no IL-17. Conversely,
      transforming growth factor-beta inhibited IL-22 production but promoted
      IL-17. Thus, IL-17 and IL-22 are differentially regulated during
      cytokine-induced Th cell differentiation. This has important implications
      for the understanding and pharmacologic manipulation of Th17-associated
      pathologies.

TI  - Interleukin-1 and IL-23 induce innate IL-17 production from gammadelta T
      cells, amplifying Th17 responses and autoimmunity.
PG  - 331-41
AB  - Th17 cells, CD4(+) T cells that secrete interleukin-17 (IL-17), are
      pathogenic in autoimmune diseases and their development and expansion is
      driven by the cytokines IL-6, TGF-beta, IL-21, IL-1, and IL-23. However,
      there are also innate sources of IL-17. Here, we show that gammadelta T
      cells express IL-23R and the transcription factor RORgammat and produce
      IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 in response to IL-1beta and IL-23, without T cell
      receptor engagement. IL-17-producing gammadelta T cells were found at high
      frequency in the brain of mice with experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE). gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and
      IL-23 promoted IL-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and increased
      susceptibility to EAE, suggesting that gammadelta T cells act in an
      amplification loop for IL-17 production by Th17 cells. Our findings
      demonstrate that gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and IL-23 are an
      important source of innate IL-17 and IL-21 and provide an alternative
      mechanism whereby IL-1 and IL-23 may mediate autoimmune inflammation.

TI  - Interleukin-17 and systemic lupus erythematosus: current concepts.
PG  - 209-15
AB  - The emerging role of interleukin (IL)-17 as a hallmark proinflammatory
      cytokine of the adaptive immune system, produced primarily by a new T
      helper cell subset termed 'Th17', has received considerable attention.
      Differentiation of Th17 cells is driven by the simultaneous presence of
      transforming growth factor-beta and certain inflammatory cytokines (e.g.
      IL-6, IL-21), and recent studies have shown that inflammation instigated
      by IL-17-producing cells is central to the development and pathogenesis of
      several human autoimmune diseases and animal models of autoimmunity. In
      this review, we focus on the information regarding IL-17 and systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic autoimmune disease. The work that has
      explored the development and behaviour of IL-17-producing cells in SLE is
      discussed, and different mechanisms by which IL-17 could potentially
      augment inflammation and autoantibody production in the context of SLE are
      proposed.

TI  - Defects along the T(H)17 differentiation pathway underlie genetically
      distinct forms of the hyper IgE syndrome.
PG  - 342-8, 348.e1-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hyper IgE syndrome (HIES) is characterized by abscesses,
      eczema, recurrent infections, skeletal and connective tissue
      abnormalities, elevated serum IgE, and diminished inflammatory responses.
      It exists as autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive forms that
      manifest common and distinguishing clinical features. A majority of those
      with autosomal-dominant HIES have heterozygous mutations in signal
      transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 and impaired T(H)17
      differentiation. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate mechanisms underlying different
      forms of HIES. METHODS: A cohort of 25 Turkish children diagnosed with
      HIES were examined for STAT3 mutations by DNA sequencing. Activation of
      STAT3 by IL-6 and IL-21 and STAT1 by IFN-alpha was assessed by
      intracellular staining with anti-phospho (p)STAT3 and -pSTAT1 antibodies.
      T(H)17 and T(H)1 cell differentiation was assessed by measuring the
      production of IL-17 and IFN-gamma, respectively. RESULTS: Six subjects had
      STAT3 mutations affecting the DNA binding, Src homology 2, and
      transactivation domains, including 3 novel ones. Mutation-positive but not
      mutation-negative subjects with HIES exhibited reduced phosphorylation of
      STAT3 in response to cytokine stimulation, whereas pSTAT1 activation was
      unaffected. Both patient groups exhibited impaired T(H)17 responses, but
      whereas STAT3 mutations abrogated early steps in T(H)17 differentiation,
      the defects in patients with HIES with normal STAT3 affected more distal
      steps. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of Turkish children with HIES, a
      majority had normal STAT3, implicating other targets in disease
      pathogenesis. Impaired T(H)17 responses were evident irrespective of the
      STAT3 mutation status, indicating that different genetic forms of HIES
      share a common functional outcome.

TI  - A Th17-like developmental process leads to CD8(+) Tc17 cells with reduced
      cytotoxic activity.
PG  - 1716-25
AB  - Activation of naive CD8(+) T cells with antigen in the absence of skewing
      cytokines triggers their differentiation into effector CTL, which induces
      death of target cells. We show that CD8(+) T cells activated in the
      presence of the cytokines IL-6 or IL-21 plus TGF-beta similar to CD4(+) T
      cells, develop into IL-17-producing (Tc17) cells. These cells display
      greatly suppressed cytotoxic function along with low levels of the CTL
      markers: T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin, granzyme B and
      IFN-gamma. Instead, these cells express hallmark molecules of Th17 program
      including retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)gammat,
      RORalpha, IL-21 and IL-23R. The expression of the type 17 master regulator
      RORgammat is causally linked to Tc17 generation, because its
      overexpression stimulates production of IL-17 in the presence of IL-6 or
      IL-21. Both, upregulation of the type 17 program as well as suppression of
      CTL differentiation are STAT3 dependent. Furthermore, Tc17 cells producing
      IL-17 but not granzyme B are also detectable in EAE, a mouse model for
      multiple sclerosis. Our data point to the existence of mutually exclusive
      CTL and Tc17 developmental pathways in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by curcumin
      treatment through inhibition of IL-17 production.
PG  - 575-81
AB  - Experimental autoimmune encephalomylitis (EAE), an animal mode of multiple
      sclerosis (MS), was previously considered that be mediated by Th1 cells.
      However, a number of recent studies provided strong evidence that T helper
      cells that produce IL-17 play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of EAE.
      Curcumin (1,7-Bis 94-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6 heptadiene-3, 5-di-one)
      is a naturally occurring polyphenolic phytochemical isolated from the
      rhizome of the medicinal plant Curcuma longa. It has been strongly
      implicated as an anti-inflammatory agent, but the precise mechanisms of
      its action are largely unknown. In the present study, we have investigated
      the efficacy and mechanism of curcumin against EAE. The treatment of Lewis
      rats with curcumin significantly reduced the clinical severity of EAE, and
      had a dramatic reduction in the number of inflammatory cells infiltration
      in the spinal cord. The proliferation of the MBP-reaction lymphocyte also
      was reduced in a curcumin dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mRNA
      expression of the cytokine profiles was assessed by quantitative
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), revealing the
      dramatic decrease of IL-17, TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-21, STAT3, and RORgammat
      expression in curcumin-treated groups and STAT3-phosphorylation also was
      inhibited. These findings indicated that curcumin amelioration EAE was, to
      a large extent, due to inhibit differentiation and development of Th17
      cells depends on down-regulating expression of IL-6, IL-21, RORgammat
      signaling and inhibition STAT3-phosphorylation, suggests it is useful in
      the treatment of MS and other Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.

TI  - TGF-beta promotes Th17 cell development through inhibition of SOCS3.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - TGF-beta, together with IL-6 and IL-21, promotes Th17 cell development.
      IL-6 and IL-21 induce activation of STAT3, which is crucial for Th17 cell
      differentiation, as well as the expression of suppressor of cytokine
      signaling (SOCS)3, a major negative feedback regulator of STAT3-activating
      cytokines that negatively regulates Th17 cells. However, it is still
      largely unclear how TGF-beta regulates Th17 cell development and which
      TGF-beta signaling pathway is involved in Th17 cell development. In this
      report, we demonstrate that TGF-beta inhibits IL-6- and IL-21-induced
      SOCS3 expression, thus enhancing as well as prolonging STAT3 activation in
      naive CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells. TGF-beta inhibits IL-6-induced SOCS3 promoter
      activity in T cells. Also, SOCS3 small interfering RNA knockdown partially
      compensates for the action of TGF-beta on Th17 cell development. In mice
      with a dominant-negative form of TGF-beta receptor II and impaired
      TGF-beta signaling, IL-6-induced CD4(+) T cell expression of SOCS3 is
      higher whereas STAT3 activation is lower compared with wild-type B6 CD4(+)
      T cells. The addition of a TGF-beta receptor I kinase inhibitor that
      blocks Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling greatly, but not completely,
      abrogates the effect of TGF-beta on Th17 cell differentiation. Our data
      indicate that inhibition of SOCS3 and, thus, enhancement of STAT3
      activation is at least one of the mechanisms of TGF-beta promotion of Th17
      cell development.

TI  - Th1 and Th17 Predominance in the Enthesitis-related Arthritis Form of
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.
PG  - 1730-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A Th1 biased immune response in synovial fluid has been
      reported in children with polyarticular and extended oligoarticular-type
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We investigated T cell phenotypes
      including Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg with emphasis on Th17 and Treg, in
      order to differentiate cytokines in the enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA)
      form of JIA. METHODS: The frequencies of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells
      were determined by flow cytometry in peripheral blood (PB) and synovial
      fluid from patients with ERA and healthy subjects. Levels of interleukin
      1ss (IL-1ss), IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and transforming growth factor ss
      (TGF-ss), cytokines that influence Th17 lineage cells, were measured in
      paired plasma and synovial fluid (SF) samples by ELISA. Frequencies are
      expressed as percentages and cytokine levels as pg/ml. RESULTS: There were
      no differences in blood samples in the frequency of Th1, Th2, Th17, and
      Treg cells between patients and controls. In paired samples, the median
      frequency of CD4+IFN-gamma+ (20.49 vs 4.03; p < 0.005) and CD4+IL-17+
      (2.27 vs 0.57; p < 0.01) cells was significantly higher in SF compared to
      PB, respectively; whereas the frequency of CD4+IL-4+ (1.79 vs 2.29; p <
      0.04) cells was significantly reduced in the SF compared to PB. There was
      no difference in the frequency of regulatory T cells. Patients receiving
      methotrexate had fewer Th2 cells, whereas the Childhood Health Assessment
      Questionnaire score had a negative association with the frequency of Treg.
      Median levels of IL-1ss (p < 0.008), IL-6 (p < 0.0001), and IL-17 (p <
      0.0001) were higher in SF than in plasma and levels of TGF-ss were lower
      (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-21 were similar in SF and plasma, whereas IL-23
      was undetectable. CONCLUSION: In patients with ERA, peripheral blood Th1,
      Th2, Th17, and Treg cells were unchanged, but Th1 and Th17 cells were
      increased and Th2 cells were reduced in the SF compared to blood. Elevated
      IL-1ss and IL-6 in SF may be responsible for increased Th17 cells.

TI  - The biological and clinical importance of the 'new generation' cytokines
      in rheumatic diseases.
PG  - 230
AB  - A better understanding of cytokine biology over the last two decades has
      allowed the successful development of cytokine inhibitors against tumour
      necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6. The introduction of these
      therapies should be considered a breakthrough in the management of several
      rheumatic diseases. However, many patients will exhibit no or only partial
      response to these therapies, thus emphasising the importance of exploring
      other therapeutic strategies. In this article, we review the most recent
      information on novel cytokines that are often members of previously
      described cytokine families such as the IL-1 superfamily (IL-18 and
      IL-33), the IL-12 superfamily (IL-27 and IL-35), the IL-2 superfamily
      (IL-15 and IL-21), and IL-17. Several data derived from experimental
      models and clinical samples indicate that some of these cytokines
      contribute to the pathophysiology of arthritis and other inflammatory
      diseases. Targeting of some of these cytokines has already been tested in
      clinical trials with interesting results.

TI  - Regulation of Th17 differentiation by epidermal fatty acid-binding
      protein.
PG  - 7625-33
AB  - Epidermal fatty acid-binding protein, E-FABP, a lipid chaperone, has been
      shown to regulate the inflammatory function of macrophages and dendritic
      cells. Herein, we demonstrate that T cell expression of E-FABP promotes
      Th17 differentiation, while counterregulating development of FoxP3(+)
      regulatory T cells (Tregs). In response to immunization with myelin
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG(35-55)), E-FABP-deficient mice
      generated reduced levels of Th17 cells and elevated levels of Tregs, as
      compared with wild-type mice. Likewise, naive CD4(+) T cells isolated from
      E-FABP-deficient mice showed reduced expression of IL-17 and enhanced
      expression of FoxP3, in vitro, when subjected to Th17 or Treg polarizing
      conditions, respectively. It has been demonstrated previously that IL-21,
      induced by IL-6, stimulates the expression of the nuclear receptors
      retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)gammat and RORalpha, which in
      turn induce expression of IL-17. We found that the impaired Th17
      differentiation by E-FABP-deficient CD4(+) T cells was associated with
      lower levels of IL-21 expression in response to IL-6, as well as reduced
      expression of RORgammat and RORalpha. However, E-FABP-deficient CD4(+) T
      cells expressed significantly higher levels of the nuclear receptor
      peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor (PPAR)gamma than did wild-type
      CD4(+) T cells, and treatment with the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662
      restored expression of IL-21, RORgammat, RORalpha, and IL-17 by
      E-FABP-deficient T cells to wild-type levels. The negative influence of
      E-FABP deficiency on IL-17 expression was attributed to PPARgamma-mediated
      suppression of IL-6-induced STAT3 activity. Thus, taken together, our data
      indicate that expression of E-FABP by CD4(+) T cells contributes to the
      control of IL-6 stimulation of the IL-21/ROR/IL-17 pathway and to the
      Th17/Treg counterbalance.

TI  - IL-9 induces differentiation of TH17 cells and enhances function of FoxP3+
      natural regulatory T cells.
PG  - 12885-90
AB  - The development of T helper (T(H))17 and regulatory T (T(reg)) cells is
      reciprocally regulated by cytokines. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
      alone induces FoxP3(+) T(reg) cells, but together with IL-6 or IL-21
      induces T(H)17 cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-9 is a key molecule that
      affects differentiation of T(H)17 cells and T(reg) function. IL-9
      predominantly produced by T(H)17 cells, synergizes with TGF-beta1 to
      differentiate naive CD4(+) T cells into T(H)17 cells, while IL-9 secretion
      by T(H)17 cells is regulated by IL-23. Interestingly, IL-9 enhances the
      suppressive functions of FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T(reg) cells in vitro, and
      absence of IL-9 signaling weakens the suppressive activity of nT(regs) in
      vivo, leading to an increase in effector cells and worsening of
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The mechanism of IL-9 effects
      on T(H)17 and T(regs) is through activation of STAT3 and STAT5 signaling.
      Our findings highlight a role of IL-9 as a regulator of pathogenic versus
      protective mechanisms of immune responses.

TI  - A functional IL-13 receptor is expressed on polarized murine CD4+ Th17
      cells and IL-13 signaling attenuates Th17 cytokine production.
PG  - 5317-21
AB  - IL-17A is produced from Th17 cells, and is involved in many autoimmune and
      inflammatory diseases. IL-13R has not previously been reported to be
      functionally expressed on T cells; however, we found that purified BALB/c
      CD4(+) cells polarized to Th17 with TGF-beta, IL-6, and IL-23 have
      increased mRNA and protein expression of IL-13R alpha1 and mRNA expression
      of IL-4R alpha compared with Th0, Th1, or Th2 polarized cells. The
      addition of IL-13 at Th17 polarization negatively regulated IL-17A and
      IL-21 expression, and reduced the number of CD4(+) T cells producing
      IL-17A. Further, adding IL-13 at the time of Th17 cell restimulation
      attenuated IL-17A expression. CD4(+) Th17 polarized cells from IL-4
      knockout (KO) mice also had IL-13-induced inhibition of IL-17A production,
      but this was not observed in IL-4R KO and STAT6 KO mice. Addition of IL-13
      at polarization increased IL-13R expression in wild-type Th17 cells.
      Further, IL-13 administration during Th17 polarization down-regulated
      retinoic acid-related-gammaT, the transcription required for Th17
      development; increased STAT6 phosphorylation, and up-regulated GATA3, the
      transcription factor activated during the development of Th2 cells. This
      IL-13-mediated effect was specific to Th17 cells as IL-13 neither
      decreased IFN-gamma expression by Th1 cells nor affected Th2 cell
      production of IL-4. Collectively, we have shown that Th17 cells express a
      functional IL-13R and that IL-13 negatively regulates IL-17A and IL-21
      production by decreasing retinoic acid-related-gammaT expression and while
      increasing phosphorylation of STAT6 and GATA3 expression. Therefore,
      therapeutic intervention inhibiting IL-13 production could have adverse
      consequences by up-regulating Th17 inflammation in certain disease states.

TI  - IL-23 drives pathogenic IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells.
PG  - 5296-305
AB  - IL-17-producing CD8(+) T cells (Tc17) appear to play a role in a range of
      conditions, such as autoimmunity and cancer. Thus far, Tc17 cells have
      been only marginally studied, resulting in a paucity of data on their
      biology and function. We demonstrate that Tc17 and Th17 cells share
      similar developmental characteristics, including the previously unknown
      promoting effect of IL-21 on Tc17 cell differentiation and IL-23-dependent
      expression of IL-22. Both STAT1 and STAT4 are required for optimal
      development of Tc17 cells and maximal secretion of cytokines. Tc17 cells
      are cytotoxic, and they can be either pathogenic or nonpathogenic upon
      adoptive transfer in the model of autoimmune diabetes. Tc17 cells treated
      with TGF-beta1 plus IL-6 are not diabetogenic, whereas IL-23-treated cells
      potently induce the disease. IL-17A and IL-17F are necessary but not
      sufficient for diabetes induction by Tc17 cells. Tc17 cells treated with
      TGF-beta1 plus IL-6 or IL-23 likely differ in pathogenicity due to their
      disparate capacity to attract other immune cells and initiate
      inflammation.

TI  - A pathogenic role of IL- 17 at the early stage of corneal allograft
      rejection.
PG  - 155-61
AB  - PURPOSE: Th17, recently identified as a new subset of effector Th cells,
      has been shown to be involved in microbe infection and autoimmunity.
      However, the role of these cells in organ allograft rejection remains
      largely unknown. In this study, we investigate whether Th17 cells
      participate in allogeneic corneal rejection in a mouse model. METHODS:
      Donor cornea (C57BL/6) was transplanted into orthotopic graft bed of
      Balb/c recipients. At different time points after keratoplasty, the
      expression of Th17 and Th1- related cytokines in draining cervical lymph
      nodes (LN) and grafted cornea was examined by flow cytometry and
      quantitative RT- PCR, respectively. Furthermore, IL- 17(-/-) Balb/c mice
      were used to determine the effects of Th17 cells on allogeneic cornea
      survival. Finally, the profiles of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines in
      IL- 17(-/-) recipients after transplantation were examined. RESULTS: Th17
      expression was enhanced significantly in inflamed transplants and draining
      lymph nodes at the early stage of allocorneal rejection, while
      upregulation of Th1 producing IFN- gamma was seen in the late phase. Upon
      activation by allogeneic accessory cells, responder cells in draining LN
      from transplanted recipients secreted high levels of IL- 6, TGF- beta and
      IL- 21 compared to controls, which may drive naive T cells to
      differentiate into Th17 cells. Importantly, IL- 17 deficiency led to the
      delayed development of allogeneic rejection, but did not affect the
      overall survival time of transplants. This effect correlated with
      restrained Th1 polarization and decreased production of proinflammatory
      cytokines. CONCLUSION: Th17 cells play a disease-promoting role at the
      early stage of corneal allograft rejection.

TI  - Early gene expression changes induced by the bacterial superantigen
      staphylococcal enterotoxin B and its modulation by a proteasome inhibitor.
PG  - 279-93
AB  - Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, serious systemic illness caused by
      bacterial superantigens. Nonavailability of a suitable animal model until
      recently has hampered an in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of
      TSS. In the current study, we characterized the early molecular events
      underlying TSS using our HLA-DR3 transgenic mouse model. Gene expression
      profiling using DNA microarrays identified a rapid and significant
      upregulation of several pro- as well as anti-inflammatory mediators, many
      of which have never been previously described in TSS. In vivo
      administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) led to an increase in
      the expression of Th0- (IL-2, 240-fold); Th1- (IFN-gamma, 360-fold; IL-12,
      8-fold); Th2- (IL-4, 53-fold; IL-5, 4-fold) as well as Th17-type cytokines
      (IL-21, 19-fold; IL-17, 5-fold). The immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-6,
      700-fold; IL-10, 18-fold); CC chemokines (such as CCL 2, 11, 3, 24, 17,
      12, 7), CXC chemokines (such as CXCL 1, 2, 5, 11, 10, 19); and several
      proteases (matrix metalloproteinases 13, 8, 3, and 9) were also
      upregulated. Serum levels of several of these cytokines/chemokines were
      also significantly elevated. Pathway analyses revealed significant
      modulation in a variety of biochemical and cellular functions, providing
      molecular insights into the pathogenesis of TSS. Administration of
      bortezomib, a clinically approved proteasome inhibitor capable of blocking
      NF-kappaB pathway, was able to significantly modulate the expression of a
      variety of genes induced by SEB. Thus, our study showed that TSS is a
      complex process and emphasized the potential of use of bortezomib in the
      therapy of superantigen-induced TSS.

TI  - Local cytokine profiles in knee osteoarthritis: elevated synovial fluid
      interleukin-15 differentiates early from end-stage disease.
PG  - 1040-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Much of what is known about the inflammatory response in the
      synovial membrane (SM) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) comes from
      studies of synovial tissues from end-stage disease. In this study, we
      sought to better characterize the inflammatory infiltrate in symptomatic
      patients with early signs of knee OA, and to determine how inflammatory
      cell populations relate to the pattern of cytokine and degradative enzyme
      production. METHODS: Study populations comprised patients with
      degenerative meniscal tears and early cartilage thinning undergoing
      arthroscopic procedures (early OA) and patients undergoing total knee
      replacement for end-stage OA. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) was used to measure expression of SM cytokines and enzymes
      implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis and OA, as well
      as cell lineage-specific markers. We quantified synovial fluid (SF)
      cytokines and enzymes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SM
      cell populations by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We found increased
      levels of SF interleukin-15 (IL-15) protein in the early knee OA patients
      when compared to end-stage OA. Both SF IL-15 protein and numbers of CD8
      cells within SM correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and
      three levels. TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-21 were also detectable in the SF of
      the majority of patients, and IL-15 levels were associated with IL-6
      levels. CONCLUSION: IL-15 is elevated in early knee OA, suggesting
      activation of an innate immune response in the SM. The association of
      IL-15 expression with CD8 transcripts and MMPs implicates this cytokine in
      OA pathogenesis and as a candidate therapeutic target.

TI  - A biologically active peptide mimetic of N-acetylgalactosamine/galactose.
PG  - 23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycosylated proteins and lipids are important regulatory
      factors whose functions can be altered by addition or removal of sugars to
      the glycan structure. The glycans are recognized by sugar-binding lectins
      that serve as receptors on the surface of many cells and facilitate
      initiation of an intracellular signal that changes the properties of the
      cells. We identified a peptide that mimics the ligand of an
      N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-specific lectin and asked whether the
      peptide would express specific biological activity. FINDINGS: A 12-mer
      phage display library was screened with a GalNAc-specific lectin to
      identify an amino acid sequence that binds to the lectin. Phage particles
      that were eluted from the lectin with free GalNAc were considered to have
      been bound to a GalNAc-binding site. Peptides were synthesized with the
      selected sequence as a quadravalent structure to facilitate receptor
      crosslinking. Treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 24
      h with the peptide stimulated secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) but not of
      IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The
      secretion of IL-21 was stimulated as strongly with the peptide as with
      interferon-gamma. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that the quadravalent
      peptide has biological activity with a degree of specificity. These
      effects occurred at concentrations in the nanomolar range, in contrast to
      free sugars that generally bind to proteins in the micro- to millimolar
      range.

TI  - Identification of IL-17-producing FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in humans.
PG  - 4793-8
AB  - IL-17-producing CD4(+) T helper (Th17) cells have recently been defined as
      a unique subset of proinflammatory helper cells whose development depends
      on signaling initiated by IL-6 and TGF-beta, autocrine activity of IL-21,
      activation of STAT3, and induction of the orphan nuclear receptor
      RORgammat. The maintenance, expansion, and further differentiation of the
      committed Th17 cells depend on IL-1beta and IL-23. IL-17 was originally
      found produced by circulating human CD45RO(+) memory T cells. A recent
      study found that human Th17 memory cells selectively express high levels
      of CCR6. In this study, we report that human peripheral blood and lymphoid
      tissue contain a significant number of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells that express
      CCR6 and have the capacity to produce IL-17 upon activation. These cells
      coexpress FOXP3 and RORgammat transcription factors. The
      CD4(+)FOXP3(+)CCR6(+) IL-17-producing cells strongly inhibit the
      proliferation of CD4(+) responder T cells. CD4(+)CD25(high)-derived T-cell
      clones express FOXP3, RORgammat, and IL-17 and maintain their suppressive
      function via a cell-cell contact mechanism. We further show that human
      CD4(+)FOXP3(+)CCR6(-) regulatory T (Treg) cells differentiate into IL-17
      producer cells upon T-cell receptor stimulation in the presence of
      IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-21, IL-23, and human serum. This, together with the
      finding that human thymus does not contain IL-17-producing Treg cells,
      suggests that the IL-17(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells are generated in the
      periphery. IL-17-producing Treg cells may play critical roles in
      antimicrobial defense, while controlling autoimmunity and inflammation.

TI  - Th17 cells: from precursors to players in inflammation and infection.
PG  - 489-98
AB  - Upon activation, naive CD4(+) T cells differentiate into different
      lineages of effector T(h) subsets. Each subset is characterized by its
      unique cytokine profile and biological functions. T(h)17, a newly
      described T(h) subset that produces IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22 in preference
      to other cytokines, has been shown to play an important role in clearing
      specific pathogens and in inducing autoimmune tissue inflammations. Over
      the last 2-3 years, significant progress has been made to understand the
      development and biological functions of T(h)17 subset. Transforming growth
      factor beta (TGF) together with IL-6 or IL-21 initiates the
      differentiation while IL-23 stabilizes the generation of T(h)17 cells. The
      transcription factors of T(h)17 cells [retinoid-related orphan receptor
      (ROR) gammat, ROR-alpha and signal transducer and activator of
      transcription-3] have been described recently. Since TGF-beta is essential
      for the generation of both T(h)17 and regulatory T (T(reg)) cells from
      naive T cells, which suggests a developmental link between T(h)17 and
      T(reg) cells. Functions of these two subsets of T cells are, however,
      opposite to each other; T(h)17 cells are highly pathogenic during the
      inflammatory process while T(reg) cells are crucial for inhibiting tissue
      inflammation and maintaining self-tolerance. Here, we review the recent
      information on differentiation and effector functions of T(h)17 cells
      during inflammatory conditions.

TI  - More stories on Th17 cells.
PG  - 399-411
AB  - For more than two decades, immunologists have been using the so-called
      Th1/Th2 paradigm to explain most of the phenomena related to adaptive
      immunity. The Th1/Th2 paradigm implied the existence of two different,
      mutually regulated, CD4(+) T helper subsets: Th1 cells, driving
      cell-mediated immune responses involved in tissue damage and fighting
      infection against intracellular parasites; and Th2 cells that mediate IgE
      production and are particularly involved in eosinophilic inflammation,
      allergy and clearance of helminthic infections. A third member of the T
      helper set, IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells, now called Th17 cells, was
      recently described as a distinct lineage that does not share developmental
      pathways with either Th1 or Th2 cells. The Th17 subset has been linked to
      autoimmune disorders, being able to produce IL-17, IL-17F and IL-21 among
      other inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, it has been reported that
      there is not only a cross-regulation among Th1, Th2 and Th17 effector
      cells but there is also a dichotomy in the generation of Th17 and T
      regulatory cells. Therefore, Treg and Th17 effector cells arise in a
      mutually exclusive fashion, depending on whether they are activated in the
      presence of TGF-beta or TGF-beta plus inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6.
      This review will address the discovery of the Th17 cells, and recent
      progress on their development and regulation.

TI  - IL-21 mediates suppressive effects via its induction of IL-10.
PG  - 2859-67
AB  - IL-21 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is required for normal Ig production.
      We previously showed that IL-21 was elevated in BXSB-Yaa mice with
      systemic lupus erythematosus. These mice also had elevated IL-10 levels,
      and we now show that IL-21 induces IL-10 mRNA and protein, suggesting
      unexpected immunosuppressive activities for IL-21. Indeed, Th1 priming
      with IL-21 leads to accumulation of cells with immunosuppressive activity,
      and IL-21 overexpression decreases specific Ab production after
      immunization in an IL-10-dependent fashion. Moreover, we show that IL-21
      signaling is required for maximal induction of IL-10 by IL-6 or IL-27.
      Overall, our data indicate that IL-21 regulates immune responses at least
      in part by inducing IL-10 and reveal unanticipated immunosuppressive
      actions for this cytokine.

TI  - High expression of BCL3 in human myeloma cells is associated with
      increased proliferation and inferior prognosis.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: BCL3 is a putative oncogene encoding for a protein belonging
      to the inhibitory kappaB-family. We experienced that this putative
      oncogene was a common target gene for growth-promoting cytokines in
      myeloma cell lines. METHODS: Gene expression of BCL3 was studied in 351
      newly diagnosed myeloma patients, 12 patients with smouldering myeloma, 44
      patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and 22
      healthy individuals. Smaller material of samples was included for mRNA
      detection by RT-PCR, protein detection by Western blot and
      immunohistochemistry, and for cytogenetic studies. A total of eight
      different myeloma cell lines were studied. RESULTS: Bcl-3 was induced in
      myeloma cell lines by interleukin (IL)-6, IL-21, IL-15, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha and IGF-1, and its upregulation was associated with increased
      proliferation of the cells. In a population of 351 patients, expression
      levels of BCL3 above 75th percentile were associated with shorter 5-yr
      survival. When this patient population was divided into subgroups based on
      molecular classification, BCL3 was significantly increased in a poor risk
      subgroup characterized by overexpression of cell cycle and proliferation
      related genes. Intracellular localization of Bcl-3 was dependent on type
      of stimulus given to the cell. CONCLUSION: BCL3 is a common target gene
      for several growth-promoting cytokines in myeloma cells and high
      expression of BCL3 at the time of diagnosis is associated with poor
      prognosis of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). These data may indicate
      a potential oncogenic role for Bcl-3 in MM.

TI  - The induction of antibody production by IL-6 is indirectly mediated by
      IL-21 produced by CD4+ T cells.
PG  - 69-78
AB  - Interleukin (IL) 6 is a proinflammtory cytokine produced by
      antigen-presenting cells and nonhematopoietic cells in response to
      external stimuli. It was initially identified as a B cell growth factor
      and inducer of plasma cell differentiation in vitro and plays an important
      role in antibody production and class switching in vivo. However, it is
      not clear whether IL-6 directly affects B cells or acts through other
      mechanisms. We show that IL-6 is sufficient and necessary to induce IL-21
      production by naive and memory CD4(+) T cells upon T cell receptor
      stimulation. IL-21 production by CD4(+) T cells is required for IL-6 to
      promote B cell antibody production in vitro. Moreover, administration of
      IL-6 with inactive influenza virus enhances virus-specific antibody
      production, and importantly, this effect is dependent on IL-21. Thus, IL-6
      promotes antibody production by promoting the B cell helper capabilities
      of CD4(+) T cells through increased IL-21 production. IL-6 could therefore
      be a potential coadjuvant to enhance humoral immunity.

TI  - IL-17 and Th17 Cells.
PG  - 485-517
AB  - CD4+ T cells, upon activation and expansion, develop into different T
      helper cell subsets with different cytokine profiles and distinct effector
      functions. Until recently, T cells were divided into Th1 or Th2 cells,
      depending on the cytokines they produce. A third subset of IL-17-producing
      effector T helper cells, called Th17 cells, has now been discovered and
      characterized. Here, we summarize the current information on the
      differentiation and effector functions of the Th17 lineage. Th17 cells
      produce IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22, thereby inducing a massive tissue
      reaction owing to the broad distribution of the IL-17 and IL-22 receptors.
      Th17 cells also secrete IL-21 to communicate with the cells of the immune
      system. The differentiation factors (TGF-beta plus IL-6 or IL-21), the
      growth and stabilization factor (IL-23), and the transcription factors
      (STAT3, RORgammat, and RORalpha) involved in the development of Th17 cells
      have just been identified. The participation of TGF-beta in the
      differentiation of Th17 cells places the Th17 lineage in close
      relationship with CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), as TGF-beta
      also induces differentiation of naive T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs in the
      peripheral immune compartment. The investigation of the differentiation,
      effector function, and regulation of Th17 cells has opened up a new
      framework for understanding T cell differentiation. Furthermore, we now
      appreciate the importance of Th17 cells in clearing pathogens during host
      defense reactions and in inducing tissue inflammation in autoimmune
      disease.

TI  - IRF4 is essential for IL-21-mediated induction, amplification, and
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype.
PG  - 20846-51
AB  - Differentiation of murine T-helper (Th) 17 cells is induced by antigenic
      stimulation and the sequential action of the cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and
      IL-23, along with TGFbeta. Current dogma proposes that IL-6 induces IL-21,
      which, in a STAT3-dependent manner, amplifies its own transcription,
      contributes to IL-17 production, and, moreover, promotes the expression of
      the IL-23 receptor. This, in turn, prepares cells for IL-23-mediated
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype. Here we demonstrate that these
      effects of IL-21 on Th17 differentiation are completely dependent on IFN
      regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). After culturing in the presence of IL-21 plus
      TGFbeta, IRF4-deficient (Irf4(-/-)) Th cells showed a profound intrinsic
      defect in IL-17 production and in the autocrine IL-21 loop. Likewise, the
      levels of IL-23 receptor and the lineage-specific orphan nuclear receptors
      RORalpha and RORgammat were diminished, whereas the T regulatory (Treg)
      transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) was strongly up-regulated,
      consistent with the reciprocal relationship between Th17 and Treg
      development. Despite this loss of IL-21 functions, IL-21-induced STAT3
      activation was unimpaired and induced normal Socs3 expression. Forced
      expression of Foxp3 in WT cells inhibited IL-21-mediated IL-17 production,
      suggesting that the increase in Foxp3 contributes to the Irf4(-/-)
      phenotype. Additionally, the low levels of RORalpha and RORgammat are also
      partially responsible, because simultaneous overexpression of both
      proteins restored IL-17 production in Irf4(-/-) cells to some extent.
      These data highlight IRF4 as a decisive factor during the IL-21-mediated
      steps of Th17 development by influencing the balance of Foxp3, RORalpha,
      and RORgammat.

TI  - Dendritic cell IL-23 and IL-1 production in response to schistosome eggs
      induces Th17 cells in a mouse strain prone to severe immunopathology.
PG  - 8559-67
AB  - Infection with schistosomes results in a CD4 T cell-mediated inflammatory
      reaction against parasite eggs that varies greatly in magnitude both in
      humans as well as in mice. In the murine disease, the severe form of
      immunopathology correlates with high levels of IL-17. We now report that
      live schistosome eggs stimulate dendritic cells from high pathology-prone
      CBA mice to produce IL-12p40, IL-6, and TGF-beta, whereas those from low
      pathology-prone BL/6 mice only make TGF-beta. Moreover, egg-stimulated
      dendritic cells plus naive CD4 T cells from CBA mice resulted in increased
      levels of IL-6, IL-23, IL-1beta, as well as IL-17 and the chemokines
      CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, whereas similarly treated BL/6 cell cocultures
      instead expressed higher IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and the transcription factor
      Foxp3. Neutralization of IL-23 and IL-1, but not of IL-6 or IL-21,
      profoundly inhibited egg-induced IL-17 production in the CBA cocultures.
      Conversely, stimulation with schistosome eggs in the presence of exogenous
      IL-23 and IL-1beta induced BL/6 cells to make IL-17. These findings
      identify IL-23 and IL-1 as critical host factors that drive IL-17
      production, and suggest that parasite recognition followed by a
      genetically determined innate proinflammatory response induces the
      development of Th17 cells and thus controls the outcome of immunopathology

TI  - CCR6 regulates the migration of inflammatory and regulatory T cells.
PG  - 8391-401
AB  - Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells play opposite roles in autoimmune
      diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying their proper migration to
      inflammatory tissues are unclear. In this study, we report that these two
      T cell subsets both express CCR6. CCR6 expression in Th17 cells is
      regulated by TGF-beta and requires two nuclear receptors, RORalpha and
      RORgamma. Th17 cells also express the CCR6 ligand CCL20, which is induced
      synergistically by TGF-beta and IL-6, which requires STAT3, RORgamma and
      IL-21. Th17 cells, by producing CCL20, promote migration of Th17 and Treg
      cells in vitro in a CCR6-dependent manner. Lack of CCR6 in Th17 cells
      reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Th17
      and Treg recruitment into inflammatory tissues. Similarly, CCR6 on Treg
      cells is also important for their recruitment into inflammatory tissues.
      Our data indicate an important role of CCR6 in Treg and Th17 cell
      migration.

TI  - Interleukin-6/STAT3 signaling regulates the ability of naive T cells to
      acquire B-cell help capacities.
PG  - 2426-33
AB  - The conditions leading to the activation/differentiation of T-helper (Th)
      cells dedicated for B-cell antibody production are still poorly
      characterized. We now demonstrate that interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes the
      differentiation of naive T lymphocytes into helper cells able to promote
      B-cell activation and antibody secretion. IL-6-driven acquisition of
      B-cell help capacity requires expression of the signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), but not STAT4 or STAT6 transcription
      factors, suggesting that the ability to provide help to B cells is not
      restricted to a well-defined Th1 or Th2 effector population. T
      cell-specific STAT3-deficient mice displayed reduced humoral responses in
      vivo that could not be related to an altered expansion of CXCR5-expressing
      helper T cells. IL-6 was shown to promote IL-21 secretion, a cytokine that
      was similarly found to promote the differentiation of naive T cells into
      potent B-cell helper cells. Collectively, these data indicate that the
      ability to provide B-cell help is regulated by IL-6/IL-21 through STAT3
      activation, independently of Th1, Th2, Th17, or follicular helper T cell
      (T(FH)) differentiation.

TI  - Induction, function and regulation of IL-17-producing T cells.
PG  - 2636-49
AB  - Recent reports have provided convincing evidence that IL-17-producing T
      cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of organ-specific autoimmune
      diseases, a function previously attributed exclusively to
      IFN-gamma-secreting Th1 cells. Furthermore, it appears that
      IL-17-producing T cells can also function with Th1 cells to mediate
      protective immunity to pathogens. Although much of the focus has been on
      IL-17-secreting CD4+ T cells, termed Th17 cells, CD8+ T cells, gammadelta
      T cells and NKT cells are also capable of secreting IL-17. The
      differentiation of Th17 cells from naive T cells appears to involve
      signals from TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-21, IL-1beta and IL-23. Furthermore,
      IL-1alpha or IL-1beta in synergy with IL-23 can promote IL-17 secretion
      from memory T cells. The induction or function of Th17 cells is regulated
      by cytokines secreted by the other major subtypes of T cells, including
      IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and at high concentrations, TGF-beta. The main
      function of IL-17-secreting T cells is to mediate inflammation, by
      stimulating production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha,
      IL-1beta and IL-6, and inflammatory chemokines that promote the
      recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages.

TI  - Retinoic acid increases Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and inhibits development
      of Th17 cells by enhancing TGF-beta-driven Smad3 signaling and inhibiting
      IL-6 and IL-23 receptor expression.
PG  - 2277-84
AB  - The de novo generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the
      peripheral immune compartment and the differentiation of Th17 cells both
      require TGF-beta, and IL-6 and IL-21 are switch factors that drive the
      development of Th17 cells at the expense of Treg cell generation. The
      major vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA) not only enforces
      the generation of Treg cells but also inhibits the differentiation of Th17
      cells. Herein we show that RA enhances TGF-beta signaling by increasing
      the expression and phosphorylation of Smad3, and this results in increased
      Foxp3 expression even in the presence of IL-6 or IL-21. RA also inhibits
      the expression of IL-6Ralpha, IRF-4, and IL-23R and thus inhibits Th17
      development. In vitro, RA significantly promotes Treg cell conversion, but
      in vivo during the development of experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis it does not increase the frequency of Treg cells in the
      face of an ongoing inflammation. However, RA suppresses the disease very
      efficiently by inhibiting proinflammatory T cell responses, especially
      pathogenic Th17 responses. These data not only identify the signaling
      mechanisms by which RA can affect both Treg cell and Th17 differentiation,
      but they also highlight that in vivo during an autoimmune reaction, RA
      suppresses autoimmunity mainly by inhibiting the generation of effector
      Th17 cells.

TI  - New complexities in helper T cell fate determination and the implications
      for autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 533-41
AB  - Recently, new complexities in cell fate decision for helper T cells have
      emerged. One new lineage, which has come to be called Th17 cells,
      selectively produces proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-17
      (IL-17, A and F), IL-21, and IL-22. In conjunction with transforming
      growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta-1), IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23, which activate
      the transcription factor, signal transducer, and activator of
      transcription 3 (Stat3), the expression of another transcription factor,
      retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gammat (RORgammat) leads to the
      differentiation of Th17 cells in mice. Other cytokines including IL-2,
      IL-4, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and IL-27 inhibit Th17
      differentiation. However, IL-2 acting with TGFbeta-1 induces
      differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells to become regulatory T cells
      (Tregs). Th17 cells are now known to play an important role not only in
      the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmune diseases, but also host
      defense against extracellular bacteria. Conversely, extensive data
      substantiate the role of Tregs as essential in maintenance of peripheral
      tolerance. Selectively targeting Tregs and Th17 cells are likely to be
      important strategies in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune
      diseases in humans.

      IL-17 is supported by various cytokines, including IL-23, IL-1beta, IL-21,
      IL-15 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. In this study, the influence
      of a multifunctional cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor
      (MIF), on IL-17 production in mice was investigated. Treatment of lymph
      node cells (LNCs) with recombinant MIF up-regulated mitogen-stimulated
      IL-17 expression and secretion. Additionally, LNCs from MIF knockout mice
      (mif(-/-)) had severely impaired production of IL-17, as well as of
      IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-23 and TGF-beta. When stimulated with recombinant
      IL-1beta, IL-23 or TNF-alpha, mitogen-triggered mif(-/-) LNCs were fully
      able to achieve the IL-17 production seen in wild-type (WT) LNCs, while
      the addition of IL-6 and TGF-beta had no effect. Finally, after injection
      of mice with complete Freund's adjuvant, secretion of IL-17 as well as the
      number of IL-17-positive cells was significantly lower in the draining
      lymph nodes of mif(-/-) mice in comparison with WT mice. The effect of MIF
      on IL-17 production was dependent on p38, extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Janus kinase 2/signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Jak2/STAT3), and not on
      nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
      signalling. Bearing in mind the contribution of MIF and IL-17 to the
      pathology of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, from the results
      presented here it seems plausible that targeting MIF biological activity
      could be a valid therapeutic approach for the treatment of such diseases.

TI  - Human CD25highFoxp3pos regulatory T cells differentiate into
      IL-17-producing cells.
PG  - 2340-52
AB  - The effector T-cell lineage shows great plasticity. Th17 cells are
      acknowledged to be instrumental in the response against microbial
      infection, but are also associated with autoimmune inflammatory processes.
      Here, we report that human regulatory T cells
      (CD4(pos)CD25(high)Foxp3(pos)CD127(neg)CD27(pos)) can differentiate into
      IL-17-producing cells, when stimulated by allogeneic antigen-presenting
      cells, especially monocytes, in the presence of rhIL-2/rhIL-15. These
      regulatory T cell (Treg)-derived IL-17-producing cells showed high
      expression of the Th17-related transcription factor RORgammat and were
      positively identified by CCR6 expression. This differentiation process was
      enhanced by exogenous IL-1beta, IL-23, and IL-21, whereas IL-6 or TGFbeta
      did not affect the emergence of IL-17-producing cells. The addition of
      IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), but not anti-IL-23 antibody, reduced
      IL-17-producing cell numbers. When an histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor
      trichostatin A (TSA) was evaluated, we found a profound negative effect on
      the emergence of IL-17-producing cells from Tregs, implying that Treg
      differentiation into IL-17-producing cells depends on histone/protein
      deacetylase activity. Thus, the data suggest that epigenetic modification
      underlies the phenomenon of Treg plasticity here described.

TI  - Generation of T follicular helper cells is mediated by interleukin-21 but
      independent of T helper 1, 2, or 17 cell lineages.
PG  - 138-49
AB  - After activation, CD4(+) helper T (Th) cells differentiate into distinct
      effector subsets. Although chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 5-expressing T
      follicular helper (Tfh) cells are important in humoral immunity, their
      developmental regulation is unclear. Here we show that Tfh cells had a
      distinct gene expression profile and developed in vivo independently of
      the Th1 or Th2 cell lineages. Tfh cell generation was regulated by ICOS
      ligand (ICOSL) expressed on B cells and was dependent on interleukin-21
      (IL-21), IL-6, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
      (STAT3). However, unlike Th17 cells, differentiation of Tfh cells did not
      require transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or Th17-specific orphan
      nuclear receptors RORalpha and RORgamma in vivo. Finally, naive T cells
      activated in vitro in the presence of IL-21 but not TGF-beta signaling
      preferentially acquired Tfh gene expression and promoted germinal-center
      reactions in vivo. This study thus demonstrates that Tfh is a distinct Th
      cell lineage.

TI  - Phenotypic switching in Cryptococcus neoformans contributes to virulence
      by changing the immunological host response.
PG  - 4322-31
AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated opportunistic organism that can
      undergo phenotypic switching. In this process, the parent smooth colony
      (SM) switches to a more virulent mucoid colony (MC) variant. The host
      responses mounted against the SM and MC variants differ, and lower tissue
      interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels are consistently observed in lungs of
      MC-infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. This suggested different roles of
      this cytokine in SM and MC infections. The objective of this study was to
      compare survival rates and characterize the host responses of SM- and
      MC-infected IL-10-depleted (IL-10(-/-)) mice, which exhibit a
      Th1-polarized immune response and are considered resistant hosts. As
      expected, SM-infected IL-10(-/-) mice survived longer than wild-type mice,
      whereas MC-infected IL-10(-/-) mice did not exhibit a survival benefit.
      Consistent with this observation, we demonstrated marked differences in
      the inflammatory responses of SM- and MC-infected IL-10(-/-) and wild-type
      mice. This included a more Th1-polarized inflammatory response with
      enhanced recruitment of macrophages and natural killer and CD8 cells in
      MC- than in SM-infected IL-10(-/-) and wild-type mice. In contrast, both
      SM-infected IL-10(-/-) and wild-type mice exhibited higher recruitment of
      CD4 cells, consistent with enhanced survival and differences in
      recruitment and Th1/Th2 polarization. Lung tissue levels of IL-21, IL-6,
      IL-4, transforming growth factor beta, IL-12, and gamma interferon were
      higher in MC-infected IL-10(-/-) and wild-type mice than in SM-infected
      mice, whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were higher in
      SM-infected IL-10(-/-) mice. In conclusion, the MC variant elicits an
      excessive inflammatory response in a Th1-polarized host environment, and
      therefore, the outcome is negatively affected by the absence of IL-10.

TI  - Activation-dependent induction of Blimp-1.
PG  - 259-64
AB  - B lymphocyte induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1) mRNA is induced upon
      antigen-dependent activation of both T and B lymphocytes, in spite of the
      fact that it plays very different roles in the two lineages. B cells have
      at least four different mechanisms to repress Blimp-1 and repression is
      relieved before induction. Only one repressor, Bcl-6, is known in T cells.
      Activators must also be present to induce Blimp-1 in both T and B cells.
      Cytokines IL-21, IL-10, and IL-6, activating STAT3, are crucial in B cells
      along with toll-like receptor (TLR) signals, whereas IL-2 is crucial in T
      cells. AP-1, NF-kappaB, and IRF4 also activate Blimp-1.

TI  - IL-21 and IL-21R are not required for development of Th17 cells and
      autoimmunity in vivo.
PG  - 1833-8
AB  - Th17 cells have been recognized as the central effectors in organ-related
      autoimmune diseases. IL-6 is a key factor that reciprocally regulates Th17
      and Foxp3(+) Treg differentiation by inhibition of TGF-beta induced Foxp3
      and induction of RORgammat, a Th17 lineage-specific transcription factor.
      Recently IL-21 has been suggested to induce RORgammat and Th17 development
      in the absence of IL-6. However, the relevance of IL-21 for Th17-dependent
      inflammatory responses in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we
      demonstrate that differentiation of IL-17-producing CD4 T cells, their
      recruitment to inflamed organs, and the development of autoimmune disease
      was not affected in il21R(-/-) and il21(-/-) mice in models of myelin
      oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced autoimmune encephalitis and
      autoimmune myocarditis. IL-6 induced Th17 differentiation independent of
      and much more potently than IL-21 in vitro. These data suggest that IL-6
      is sufficient to drive Th17 development and associated autoimmunity in
      vivo in the absence of IL-21 or IL-21R.

TI  - IL-6, in synergy with IL-7 or IL-15, stimulates TCR-independent
      proliferation and functional differentiation of CD8+ T lymphocytes.
PG  - 7958-68
AB  - Recent reports have shown that IL-21, in synergy with IL-15, stimulates
      proliferation of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the absence of signaling via the
      TCR. In this study, we show that IL-6, which induces phosphorylation of
      STAT3 similarly to IL-21, also can stimulate proliferation of CD8(+) T
      cells in synergy with IL-7 or IL-15. IL-6 displays a stronger synergy with
      IL-7 than with IL-15 to stimulate naive CD8(+) T cells. Concomitant
      stimulation by IL-6 or IL-21 augments phosphorylation and DNA-binding
      activity of STAT5 induced by IL-7 or IL-15. Like IL-21, IL-6 reduces the
      TCR signaling threshold required to stimulate CD8(+) T cells. Prior
      culture of P14 TCR transgenic CD8 T cells with IL-6 or IL-21 in the
      presence of IL-7 or IL-15 augments their proliferation and cytolytic
      activity upon subsequent stimulation by Ag. Furthermore, cytokine
      stimulation induces quantitatively and qualitatively distinct phenotypic
      changes on CD8(+) T cells compared with those induced by TCR signaling. We
      propose that the ability of IL-6 to induce TCR-independent activation of
      CD8(+) T cells in synergy with IL-7 or IL-15 may play an important role in
      the transition from innate to adaptive immunity.

TI  - Cytokines secreted in response to Toll-like receptor ligand stimulation
      modulate differentiation of human Th17 cells.
PG  - 1619-29
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Th17 cells (interleukin-17 [IL-17]-secreting T helper cells)
      have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and other
      autoimmune diseases, but the soluble factors that influence human Th17
      differentiation have yet to be fully elucidated. This study was undertaken
      to investigate the hypothesis that the cytokines secreted by human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to a subset of
      Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands would influence Th17 polarization.
      METHODS: Supernatants from human PBMCs treated with a panel of TLR
      agonists were tested for their ability to induce de novo IL-17 production
      in naive T helper cells. Multiplex cytokine analysis was used to identify
      candidate cytokines for subsequent blocking and sufficiency experiments.
      RESULTS: Conditioned media from PBMCs stimulated with TLR-4 or TLR-8/7
      agonists, but not from those stimulated with TLR-2/1, -3, or -9 agonists,
      evoked robust secretion of IL-17 by T helper cells, independent of
      coculture with antigen-presenting cells. Multiplex analysis of 22
      cytokines and chemokines identified a 6-factor cytokine signature that
      significantly correlated with IL-17-inducing activity. T cell activation
      in the presence of recombinant IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-23 reconstituted
      robust IL-17 production, and this was enhanced by transforming growth
      factor beta (TGFbeta). IL-6 suppressed the expression of forkhead box P3
      and reversed TGFbeta-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation, but did
      not trigger IL-17 secretion. IL-17 production was completely abrogated by
      anti-IL-1 or IL-1 receptor antagonist and partially inhibited by
      anti-IL-6, anti-IL-2, or exogenous retinoic acid, but not by anti-tumor
      necrosis factor alpha. IL-1beta and IL-6 independently induced IL-21
      secretion, but the presence of IL-21 alone was not sufficient for IL-17
      production. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ligation of a subset
      of TLRs generates proinflammatory cytokines that combine to potentiate
      human Th17 differentiation.

TI  - Neutralizing IL-21 and IL-15 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production
      in rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - Interleukin IL-21 and IL-15 belong to the common gamma-chain receptor
      family. IL-15 represents a novel therapeutic target in rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA), whereas less is known about the role of IL-21 in human
      inflammatory diseases. We have analysed the effects of blocking IL-21 and
      IL-15 on spontaneous production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA
      synovial cell cultures. RA synovial membrane cells were cultured in the
      presence of an IL-21R-Fc chimera or a neutralizing IL-15 antibody and
      production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta was
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression of IL-21
      and IL-15 in RA synovium was measured by RT-PCR and ELISA. mRNA for IL-21
      and IL-21R was detected in the culture cell lysates. Protein for IL-15 was
      found at detectable levels in the cell lysates. Both the IL-21R-Fc chimera
      and anti-IL-15 antibody inhibited cytokine release, although substantially
      more IL-21R-Fc was needed. IL-21R-Fc at the highest dose (100 microg/ml)
      significantly reduced TNFalpha production by 50%, IL-6 by 57% and IL-1beta
      by 81%. Anti-IL-15 antibody (5 microg/ml) significantly inhibited TNFalpha
      release by 51%, IL-6 by 37% and IL-1beta by 82% in line with previous
      published observations. The data confirm that IL-15 plays a role in RA and
      suggests that IL-21 is also involved in driving the pro-inflammatory
      cytokine response in RA.

TI  - Development and characterization of IL-21-producing CD4+ T cells.
PG  - 1369-79
AB  - It has recently been shown that interleukin (IL)-21 is produced by Th17
      cells, functions as an autocrine growth factor for Th17 cells, and plays
      critical roles in autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the
      differentiation and characteristics of IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells by
      intracellular staining. Unexpectedly, we found that under Th17-polarizing
      conditions, the majority of IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells did not produce
      IL-17A and -17F. We also found that IL-6 and -21 potently induced the
      development of IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells without the induction of
      IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, or IL-17F production. On the other hand, TGF-beta
      inhibited IL-6- and IL-21-induced development of IL-21-producing CD4(+) T
      cells. IL-2 enhanced the development of IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells
      under Th17-polarizing conditions. Finally, IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells
      exhibited a stable phenotype of IL-21 production in the presence of IL-6,
      but retained the potential to produce IL-4 under Th2-polarizing conditions
      and IL-17A under Th17-polarizing conditions. These results suggest that
      IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells exhibit distinct characteristics from Th17
      cells and develop preferentially in an IL-6-rich environment devoid of
      TGF-beta, and that IL-21 functions as an autocrine growth factor for
      IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells.

TI  - IL-21 and TGF-beta are required for differentiation of human T(H)17 cells.
PG  - 350-2
AB  - The recent discovery of CD4(+) T cells characterized by secretion of
      interleukin (IL)-17 (T(H)17 cells) and the naturally occurring regulatory
      FOXP3(+) CD4 T cell (nT(reg)) has had a major impact on our understanding
      of immune processes not readily explained by the T(H)1/T(H)2 paradigm.
      T(H)17 and nT(reg) cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human
      autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
      inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Our recent data and the work of
      others demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and
      IL-6 are responsible for the differentiation of naive mouse T cells into
      T(H)17 cells, and it has been proposed that IL-23 may have a critical role
      in stabilization of the T(H)17 phenotype. A second pathway has been
      discovered in which a combination of TGF-beta and IL-21 is capable of
      inducing differentiation of mouse T(H)17 cells in the absence of IL-6
      (refs 6-8). However, TGF-beta and IL-6 are not capable of differentiating
      human T(H)17 cells and it has been suggested that TGF-beta may in fact
      suppress the generation of human T(H)17 cells. Instead, it has been
      recently shown that the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-23 are capable of
      driving IL-17 secretion in short-term CD4(+) T cell lines isolated from
      human peripheral blood, although the factors required for differentiation
      of naive human CD4 to T(H)17 cells are still unknown. Here we confirm that
      whereas IL-1beta and IL-6 induce IL-17A secretion from human central
      memory CD4(+) T cells, TGF-beta and IL-21 uniquely promote the
      differentiation of human naive CD4(+) T cells into T(H)17 cells
      accompanied by expression of the transcription factor RORC2. These data
      will allow the investigation of this new population of T(H)17 cells in
      human inflammatory disease.

TI  - The differentiation of human T(H)-17 cells requires transforming growth
      factor-beta and induction of the nuclear receptor RORgammat.
PG  - 641-9
AB  - T(H)-17 cells are interleukin 17 (IL-17)-secreting CD4+ T helper cells
      involved in autoimmune disease and mucosal immunity. In naive CD4+ T cells
      from mice, IL-17 is expressed in response to a combination of IL-6 or
      IL-21 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and requires
      induction of the nuclear receptor RORgammat. It has been suggested that
      the differentiation of human T(H)-17 cells is independent of TGF-beta and
      thus differs fundamentally from that in mice. We show here that TGF-beta,
      IL-1beta and IL-6, IL-21 or IL-23 in serum-free conditions were necessary
      and sufficient to induce IL-17 expression in naive human CD4+ T cells from
      cord blood. TGF-beta upregulated RORgammat expression but simultaneously
      inhibited its ability to induce IL-17 expression. Inflammatory cytokines
      relieved this inhibition and increased RORgammat-directed IL-17
      expression. Other gene products detected in T(H)-17 cells after RORgammat
      induction included the chemokine receptor CCR6, the IL-23 receptor, IL-17F
      and IL-26. Our studies identify RORgammat as having a central function in
      the differentiation of human T(H)-17 cells from naive CD4+ T cells and
      suggest that similar cytokine pathways are involved in this process in
      mice and humans.

TI  - A critical function for transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin 23
      and proinflammatory cytokines in driving and modulating human T(H)-17
      responses.
PG  - 650-7
AB  - Interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing T helper 17 cells (T(H)-17 cells) have
      been described as a T helper cell subset distinct from T helper type 1
      (T(H)1) and T(H)2 cells, with specific functions in antimicrobial defense
      and autoimmunity. The factors driving human T(H)-17 differentiation remain
      controversial. Using a systematic approach combining experimental and
      computational methods, we show here that transforming growth factor-beta,
      interleukin 23 (IL-23) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-6)
      were all essential for human T(H)-17 differentiation. However, individual
      T(H)-17 cell-derived cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-6, as
      well as the global T(H)-17 cytokine profile, were differentially modulated
      by T(H)-17-promoting cytokines. Transforming growth factor-beta was
      critical, and its absence induced a shift from a T(H)-17 profile to a
      T(H)1-like profile. Our results shed new light on the regulation of human
      T(H)-17 differentiation and provide a framework for the global analysis of
      T helper responses.

TI  - Regulation of gut inflammation and th17 cell response by interleukin-21.
PG  - 1038-48
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interleukin (IL)-21, a T-cell-derived cytokine, is
      overproduced in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but its role in the
      pathogenesis of gut inflammation remains unknown. We here examined whether
      IL-21 is necessary for the initiation and progress of experimental colitis
      and whether it regulates specific pathways of inflammation. METHODS: Both
      dextran sulfate sodium colitis and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-relapsing
      colitis were induced in wild-type and IL-21-deficient mice. CD4(+)CD25(-)
      T cells from wild-type and IL-21-deficient mice were differentiated in T
      helper cell (Th)17-polarizing conditions, with or without IL-21 or an
      antagonistic IL-21R/Fc. We also examined whether blockade of IL-21 by
      anti-IL-21 antibody reduced IL-17 in cultures of IBD lamina propria CD3(+)
      T lymphocytes. Cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: High IL-21 was
      seen in wild-type mice with dextran sulfate sodium- and trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid-relapsing colitis. IL-21-deficient mice were largely
      protected against both colitides and were unable to up-regulate
      Th17-associated molecules during gut inflammation, thus suggesting a role
      for IL-21 in controlling Th17 cell responses. Indeed, naive T cells from
      IL-21-deficient mice failed to differentiate into Th17 cells. Treatment of
      developing Th17 cells from wild-type mice with IL-21R/Fc reduced IL-17
      production. Moreover, in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta1,
      exogenous IL-21 substituted for IL-6 in driving IL-17 induction.
      Neutralization of IL-21 reduced IL-17 secretion by IBD lamina propria
      lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that IL-21 is a critical
      regulator of inflammation and Th17 cell responses in the gut.

TI  - At the horizon of innovative therapy in rheumatology: new biologic agents.
PG  - 269-75
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the rational and the results regarding the
      use of novel biologic agents in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Recent findings show that excessive IL-1 processing and release
      contribute to different rheumatic conditions, including periodic fever
      syndromes, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult Still's
      disease, and crystal-induced arthritis. Preliminary results indicate that
      administration of IL-1 receptor antagonist and other IL-1 inhibitors
      improves these conditions. IL-6 also plays a major role in the control of
      inflammatory responses. Several clinical trials have shown that inhibition
      of IL-6 by a monoclonal antibody against its receptor is efficacious in
      rheumatoid arthritis and systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis
      patients. Accumulating evidence indicates that other cytokines, including
      IL-15, IL-18, and IL-21 may also play an important role in rheumatoid
      arthritis. Several signaling pathways involved in the immune and
      inflammatory responses may also constitute novel targets. Preliminary data
      on an agent targeting the Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activators of
      transcription pathway are encouraging. SUMMARY: Beyond tumor necrosis
      factor alpha targeting, the use of inhibitors against other cytokines and
      cytokine-induced intracellular responses is leading to a promising therapy
      in the future.

TI  - TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits T(H)17 cell differentiation by
      antagonizing RORgammat function.
PG  - 236-40
AB  - T helper cells that produce IL-17 (T(H)17 cells) promote autoimmunity in
      mice and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory
      diseases. At mucosal surfaces, T(H)17 cells are thought to protect the
      host from infection, whereas regulatory T (T(reg)) cells control immune
      responses and inflammation triggered by the resident microflora.
      Differentiation of both cell types requires transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGF-beta), but depends on distinct transcription factors:
      RORgammat (encoded by Rorc(gammat)) for T(H)17 cells and Foxp3 for T(reg)
      cells. How TGF-beta regulates the differentiation of T cells with opposing
      activities has been perplexing. Here we demonstrate that, together with
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, TGF-beta orchestrates T(H)17 cell
      differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. At low
      concentrations, TGF-beta synergizes with interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-21
      (refs 9-11) to promote IL-23 receptor (Il23r) expression, favouring T(H)17
      cell differentiation. High concentrations of TGF-beta repress IL23r
      expression and favour Foxp3+ T(reg) cells. RORgammat and Foxp3 are
      co-expressed in naive CD4+ T cells exposed to TGF-beta and in a subset of
      T cells in the small intestinal lamina propria of the mouse. In vitro,
      TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits RORgammat function, at least in part
      through their interaction. Accordingly, lamina propria T cells that
      co-express both transcription factors produce less IL-17 (also known as
      IL-17a) than those that express RORgammat alone. IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23
      relieve Foxp3-mediated inhibition of RORgammat, thereby promoting T(H)17
      cell differentiation. Therefore, the decision of antigen-stimulated cells
      to differentiate into either T(H)17 or T(reg) cells depends on the
      cytokine-regulated balance of RORgammat and Foxp3.

TI  - Cutting edge: vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) induces differentiation
      of Th17 cells with a distinctive cytokine profile.
PG  - 2772-6
AB  - Immune cellular effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are
      transduced by VIP G protein-coupled receptors type 1 (VPAC1) and type 2
      (VPAC2). We now show that VIP with TGFbeta stimulates the transformation
      of CD4 T cells to a distinctive type of Th17 cell that generates IL-17 but
      not IL-6 or IL-21. VIP induction of Th17 cells was higher in VPAC2
      knockout mice than wild-type mice, suggesting that VPAC1 is the principal
      transducer. Compared with Th17 cells elicited by IL-6, those evoked by VIP
      were similar in the secretion of IL-17 and IL-22, but lacked IL-21
      secretion. Suppression of VIP induction of Th17 cells by protein kinase A
      inhibitors and enhancement by pharmacologically increased cAMP supports a
      role for this signal. The ability of VIP-VPAC1 axis signals to evoke
      development of a novel type of Th17 cells demonstrates the unique
      specificity of neuroregulatory mechanisms in the immunological
      environment.

TI  - Nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent reversal of aging-induced alterations in T
      cell cytokines.
PG  - 2142-50
AB  - Immunosenescence is characterized by decreases in protective immune
      responses and increases in inflammation and autoimmunity. The T helper
      (Th)17 subset of cluster-of-differentiation (CD)4 T cells, which is
      identified by its generation of interleukin (IL) -17, is implicated in
      autoimmune pathogenesis. To elucidate immunosenescent changes in Th17 cell
      cytokines, splenic CD4 T cells from 22- to 24-month-old (old) mice and 6-
      to 10-wk-old (young) mice were incubated on anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28
      (anti-T cell antigen receptor) antibodies. After 96 h, T cells of old
      C57BL/6 and CBA mice generated up to 20-fold more IL-17 and up to 3-fold
      more IL-6 than those of young mice; T cells of young mice generated up to
      5-fold more IL-21 than those of old mice; and no difference was found for
      IFN-gamma. At 24 h, cytokine mRNA levels paralleled 96 h cytokine
      concentrations. Naive CD4 T cells from old mice incubated on anti-T cell
      antigen receptor antibodies with transforming growth factor-beta, IL-1,
      IL-6, and IL-23 to induce de novo differentiation of Th17 cells had more
      IL-17 mRNA and produced more IL-17 than those of young mice. BAY11-7082
      and the phytochemicals triptolide and butein suppressed nuclear
      concentrations of nuclear factor-kappaB and secreted levels of IL-17,
      IL-21, and IFN-gamma in parallel, with greater potency in Th17 cells from
      young than old mice. Pharmacological correction of altered generation of
      Th17 cell cytokines in immunosenescence represents a novel therapeutic
      approach to aging-induced inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Autocrine regulation of IL-21 production in human T lymphocytes.
PG  - 1800-7
AB  - IL-21 has pathologic function in immune-inflammatory diseases. IL-21
      mediates its functions through a heterodimeric receptor, composed of a
      specific subunit, termed IL-21R, and the common gamma-chain. IL-21 is
      mostly produced by CD4(+) T cells, but molecular mechanisms that regulate
      IL-21 synthesis are not fully understood. The fact that CD4(+) T cells
      express high levels of IL-21R and are capable of functionally responding
      to IL-21 raises the possibility that IL-21 may regulate its own
      production. We here show that IL-21 enhances IL-21 RNA and protein
      expression in human peripheral blood CD3(+) T cells in a dose- and
      time-dependent fashion. Additionally, both IL-7 and IL-15, but not IL-4,
      induce IL-21, thus suggesting that common gamma-chain signals are not
      sufficient to promote IL-21 synthesis. Analysis of molecular mechanisms
      underlying IL-21 induction reveals that IL-21 activates Stat3 and enhances
      its recruitment to IL-21 gene promoter. Pharmacologic inhibition and
      knockdown of Stat3 by small interference RNA largely prevent IL-21
      induction in IL-21-treated cells. Consistently, IL-21 is inducible in T
      cells by IL-6, another cytokine that activates Stat3. Finally, we show
      that IL-21 positively regulates its own expression in human intestinal
      CD3(+) lamina propria lymphocytes, and blockade of endogenous IL-21 in
      cultures of CD3(+) lamina propria lymphocytes isolated from patients with
      Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by
      high IL-21, down-regulates Stat3 activation and IL-21 expression. These
      data suggest the existence of a positive autocrine loop that could help to
      amplify and stabilize IL-21-driven, T cell-mediated responses.

TI  - Th17 cells: a new fate for differentiating helper T cells.
PG  - 87-102
AB  - Classically naive CD4(+) have been thought to differentiate into two
      possible lineages, T helper 1 (Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Within this
      paradigm the pathogenesis of autoimmunity was suggested to predominantly
      relate to Th1 cells and the production of IFN-gamma. However, there were
      many aspects of this model that did not seem to fit, not the least of
      which was that IFN-gamma was protective in some models of autoimmunity.
      During the past 2 years, remarkable progress has been made to characterize
      a new lineage of helper T cells. Designated Th17 cells, this lineage
      selectively produces proinflammatory cytokines including IL-17, IL-21, and
      IL-22. In the mouse, the differentiation of this new lineage is initiated
      by TGFbeta-1 and IL-6 and IL-21, which activate Stat3 and induce the
      expression of the transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan
      receptor (RORgammat). IL-23, which also activates Stat3, apparently serves
      to maintain Th17 cells in vivo. In human cells, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23
      promote human Th17 differentiation, but TGFbeta-1 is reportedly not
      needed. Emerging data have suggested that Th17 plays an essential role in
      the host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi and in
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Selectively targeting the Th17
      lineage may be beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune
      diseases.

PG  - 400-8
AB  - The discovery of a new lineage of helper T cells that selectively produces
      interleukin (IL)-17 has provided exciting new insights into
      immunoregulation, host defense and the pathogenesis of autoimmune
      diseases. Additionally, the discovery of this T cell subset has offered a
      fresh look at how the complexity of selective regulation of cytokine gene
      expression might relate to lineage commitment, terminal differentiation
      and immunologic memory. Information continues to accumulate on factors
      that regulate Th17 differentiation at a rapid pace and a few lessons have
      emerged. Like other lineages, Th17 cells preferentially express a
      transcription factor, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)gammat,
      whose expression seems to be necessary for IL-17 production. In addition,
      signals from the T-cell receptor are a critical aspect of controlling
      IL-17 production and the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated
      T cells (NFATs) appears to be another important regulator. IL-6, IL-21 and
      IL-23 are all cytokines that activate the transcription factor STAT3,
      which has been established to be necessary for multiple aspects of the
      biology of Th17 cells. Similarly, TGFbeta-1 is important for the
      differentiation of murine Th17 cells and inducible regulatory T cells
      (iTregs), but how it exerts its effect on IL-17 gene transcription is
      unknown and there are data indicating TGFbeta-1 is not required for human
      Th17 differentiation. The extent to which Th17 cells represent terminally
      differentiated cells or whether they retain plasticity and can develop
      into another lineage such as IFNgamma secreting Th1 cells is also unclear.
      Precisely how cytokines produced by this lineage are selectively expressed
      and selectively extinguished through epigenetic modifications is an area
      of great importance, but considerable uncertainty.

PG  - 409-17
AB  - The paradigm of effector T helper cell differentiation into either Th1 or
      Th2 lineages has been profoundly shaken by the discovery of T cells that
      secrete IL-17 and other inflammatory cytokines. This subset, referred to
      as Th17, is centrally involved in autoimmune disease and is important in
      host defense at mucosal surfaces. In mouse, a series of cytokines,
      including IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and TGF-beta, function sequentially or
      synergistically to induce the Th17 lineage. Other cytokines, including
      IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-27, inhibit differentiation of this lineage.
      Here we review how the nuclear orphan receptor RORgammat functions to
      coordinate the diverse cytokine-induced signals and thus controls Th17
      cell differentiation.

TI  - IL-17/Th17 targeting: on the road to prevent chronic destructive
      arthritis?
PG  - 84-91
AB  - Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) contributes to the pathogenesis of arthritis.
      Data from experimental arthritis indicate IL-17 receptor signaling as a
      critical pathway in turning an acute synovitis into a chronic destructive
      arthritis. The identification of six IL-17 family members (IL-17A-F) may
      extend the role of this novel cytokine family in the pathogenesis of
      chronic destructive joint inflammation. Whether the successful anti-IL-17A
      cytokine therapy in murine arthritis can be effectively translated to
      human arthritis need to be tested in clinical trials in humans.
      Interestingly, IL-17A and IL-17F are secreted by the novel T helper subset
      named Th17. This novel pathogenic T cell population induces autoimmune
      inflammation in mice and is far more efficient at inducing Th1-mediated
      autoimmune inflammation in mice than classical Th1 cells (IFN-gamma). In
      addition to IL-17A and IL-17F, Th17 cells are characterized by expression
      of IL-6, TNF, GM-CSF, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-26. Th17 cells have been
      established as a separate lineage of T helper cells in mice distinct from
      conventional Th1 and Th2 cells. Whether this also applies to human Th17
      and whether RA is a Th1 or a Th17 mediated disease is still not clear.
      This review summarizes the findings about the role of IL-17 in arthritis
      and discusses the impact of the discovery of the novel Th17 cells for
      arthritis. Further studies are needed to unravel the role of Th17 cells
      and the interplay of IL-17 and other Th17 cytokines in the pathogenesis of
      arthritis and whether regulating Th17 cell activity will have additional
      value compared to neutralizing IL-17A activity alone. This might help to
      reach the ultimate goal not only to treat RA patients but to prevent the
      development of this crippling disease.

TI  - Optimal induction of T helper 17 cells in humans requires T cell receptor
      ligation in the context of Toll-like receptor-activated monocytes.
PG  - 17034-9
AB  - Recently, a new lineage of CD4+ T cells has been described in the mouse
      that specifically secretes IL-17 [T helper (Th) 17]. This discovery has
      led to a revision of the hypothesis that many autoimmune diseases are
      predominantly a Th1 phenomenon and may instead be critically dependent on
      the presence of Th17 cells. Murine Th17 cells differentiate from naive T
      cell precursors in the presence of TGF-beta and IL-6 or IL-21. However,
      given their putative importance in human autoimmunity, very little is
      known about the pathways that control the expression of IL-17 in humans.
      Here we show that the factors that determine the expression of IL-17 in
      human CD4+ T cells are completely different from mice. IL-6 and IL-21 were
      unable to induce IL-17 expression in either naive or effector T cells, and
      TGF-beta actually inhibited IL-17 expression. The expression of IL-17 was
      maximally induced from precommitted precursors present in human peripheral
      blood by cell-cell contact with Toll-like receptor-activated monocytes in
      the context of T cell receptor ligation. Furthermore, unlike IFN-gamma,
      IL-17 expression was not suppressed by the presence of FOXP3+ regulatory
      CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these data indicate that human and mouse
      Th17 cells have important biological differences that may be of critical
      importance in the development of therapeutic interventions in diseases

TI  - IL-21 regulates experimental colitis by modulating the balance between
      Treg and Th17 cells.
PG  - 3155-63
AB  - Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells play a key role in the maintenance of the
      immune system homeostasis. T(reg) cells can be generated in the periphery
      under control of TGF-beta, a cytokine involved in the negative control of
      the immune system. However, TGF-beta cooperates with IL-6 in the
      generation of Th17 cells, a novel class of effector cells involved in
      numerous inflammatory diseases, including colitis. Therefore, TGF-beta
      emerges as a mediator of both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory
      processes, depending on the local cytokine milieu. Here we demonstrate
      that IL-21, a type-1 cytokine produced by T cells and involved in the
      pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases, prevents the TGF-beta-dependent
      expression of FoxP3, the master regulator of T(reg) cell commitment, and
      the induction of suppressive capacity in naive CD4(+) T cells, while
      promoting the differentiation of Th17 cells. In vivo, CD4(+) naive T cells
      activated in the presence of TGF-beta and IL-21 failed to suppress colitis
      while inducing an inflammatory response characterized by high levels of
      IL-17 and RORgammat, the transcription factor expressed by Th17 cells.
      Therefore, IL-21 emerges as a key modulator of TGF-beta signaling, leading
      to the reciprocal differentiation of T(reg) and Th17 cells.

TI  - IL-21 synergizes with IL-7 to augment expansion and anti-tumor function of
      cytotoxic T cells.
PG  - 1213-21
AB  - IL-21, a recently identified member of the common gamma-chain (gammac)
      receptor cytokine family, has been shown to be an important regulator of
      both innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, we investigated
      whether IL-21 could synergize with another gammac cytokine, IL-7, to
      induce enhanced proliferation and effector function of tumor
      antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Our results showed that IL-21 could
      significantly augment the IL-7-induced expansion of cytotoxic T cells,
      possibly by preventing the cytokine-induced down-regulation of the
      IL-7Ralpha (CD127) on antigen-stimulated T cells. IL-21 also greatly
      enhanced the production of T(h)1 and inflammatory cytokines by activated T
      cells, including IFN-gamma, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, granulocyte
      macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1beta and IL-6. Finally, the
      addition of IL-21 to IL-7-cultured CTLs resulted in a considerably higher
      level of cytolytic activity, as measured by specific killing of tumor
      cells or antigen-pulsed target cells. These results suggest that IL-21 may
      play a cooperative role with IL-7 in modulating primary CD8(+) T-cell
      responses and may have important implications for immunotherapy of cancer.

TI  - Th17: the third member of the effector T cell trilogy.
PG  - 652-7
AB  - T helper responses have now grown to include three T cell subsets: Th1,
      Th2 and Th17. Th17 cells have recently emerged as a third independent T
      cell subset that may play an essential role in protection against certain
      extracellular pathogens. However, Th17 cells with specificity for
      self-antigens are highly pathogenic and lead to the development of
      inflammation and severe autoimmunity. A combination of TGF-beta plus IL-6
      and the transcription factors STAT3 and RORgammat were recently described
      to be essential for initial differentiation of Th17 cells and IL-23 for
      the later stabilization of the Th17 cell subset. Here, we introduce
      another player IL-21 produced by Th17 themselves, which plays an important
      role in the amplification of Th17 cells. Thus, Th17 cells may undergo
      three distinct steps of development: differentiation, amplification and
      stabilization in which distinct cytokines play a role.

TI  - Essential autocrine regulation by IL-21 in the generation of inflammatory
      T cells.
PG  - 480-3
AB  - After activation, CD4+ helper T (T(H)) cells differentiate into distinct
      effector subsets that are characterized by their unique cytokine
      expression and immunoregulatory function. During this differentiation,
      T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells produce interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-4,
      respectively, as autocrine factors necessary for selective lineage
      commitment. A distinct T(H) subset, termed T(HIL-17), T(H)17 or
      inflammatory T(H) (T(H)i), has been recently identified as a distinct T(H)
      lineage mediating tissue inflammation. T(H)17 differentiation is initiated
      by transforming growth factor-beta and IL-6 (refs 5-7) and reinforced by
      IL-23 (ref. 8), in which signal transduction and activators of
      transcription (STAT)3 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor
      (ROR)-gamma mediate the lineage specification. T(H)17 cells produce IL-17,
      IL-17F and IL-22, all of which regulate inflammatory responses by tissue
      cells but have no importance in T(H)17 differentiation. Here we show that
      IL-21 is another cytokine highly expressed by mouse T(H)17 cells. IL-21 is
      induced by IL-6 in activated T cells, a process that is dependent on STAT3
      but not ROR-gamma. IL-21 potently induces T(H)17 differentiation and
      suppresses Foxp3 expression, which requires STAT3 and ROR-gamma, which is
      encoded by Rorc. IL-21 deficiency impairs the generation of T(H)17 cells
      and results in protection against experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis. IL-21 is therefore an autocrine cytokine that is
      sufficient and necessary for T(H)17 differentiation, and serves as a
      target for treating inflammatory diseases.

TI  - IL-21 initiates an alternative pathway to induce proinflammatory T(H)17
      cells.
PG  - 484-7
AB  - On activation, naive T cells differentiate into effector T-cell subsets
      with specific cytokine phenotypes and specialized effector functions.
      Recently a subset of T cells, distinct from T helper (T(H))1 and T(H)2
      cells, producing interleukin (IL)-17 (T(H)17) was defined and seems to
      have a crucial role in mediating autoimmunity and inducing tissue
      inflammation. We and others have shown that transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-beta and IL-6 together induce the differentiation of T(H)17 cells,
      in which IL-6 has a pivotal function in dictating whether T cells
      differentiate into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells) or T(H)17
      cells. Whereas TGF-beta induces Foxp3 and generates T(reg) cells, IL-6
      inhibits the generation of T(reg) cells and induces the production of
      IL-17, suggesting a reciprocal developmental pathway for T(H)17 and T(reg)
      cells. Here we show that IL-6-deficient (Il6-/-) mice do not develop a
      T(H)17 response and their peripheral repertoire is dominated by Foxp3+
      T(reg) cells. However, deletion of T(reg) cells leads to the reappearance
      of T(H)17 cells in Il6-/- mice, suggesting an additional pathway by which
      T(H)17 cells might be generated in vivo. We show that an IL-2 cytokine
      family member, IL-21, cooperates with TGF-beta to induce T(H)17 cells in
      naive Il6-/- T cells and that IL-21-receptor-deficient T cells are
      defective in generating a T(H)17 response.

TI  - IL-6 programs T(H)-17 cell differentiation by promoting sequential
      engagement of the IL-21 and IL-23 pathways.
PG  - 967-74
AB  - T helper cells that produce interleukin 17 (IL-17; 'T(H)-17 cells') are a
      distinct subset of proinflammatory cells whose in vivo function requires
      IL-23 but whose in vitro differentiation requires only IL-6 and
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We demonstrate here that IL-6
      induced expression of IL-21 that amplified an autocrine loop to induce
      more IL-21 and IL-23 receptor in naive CD4(+) T cells. Both IL-21 and
      IL-23, along with TGF-beta, induced IL-17 expression independently of
      IL-6. The effects of IL-6 and IL-21 depended on STAT3, a transcription
      factor required for the differentiation of T(H)-17 cells in vivo. IL-21
      and IL-23 induced the orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat, which in synergy
      with STAT3 promoted IL-17 expression. IL-6 therefore orchestrates a series
      of 'downstream' cytokine-dependent signaling pathways that, in concert
      with TGF-beta, amplify RORgammat-dependent differentiation of T(H)-17
      cells.

TI  - Blockade of the interleukin-21/interleukin-21 receptor pathway ameliorates
      disease in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1152-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a T cell-derived cytokine that
      modulates T cell, B cell, and natural killer cell responses. In this
      study, the effects of blocking IL-21 were examined in 2 rodent models of
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to determine whether IL-21 contributes to their
      pathologic processes. METHODS: DBA/1 mice were immunized with bovine type
      II collagen and then treated with murine IL-21 receptor Fc fusion protein
      (IL-21R.Fc), which was initiated after the onset of arthritis symptoms in
      10% of the cohort. The mice were assessed 3 times per week for signs of
      disease, including histologic features as well as serum cytokine, Ig, and
      cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the paws. In a separate
      experiment, Lewis rats were immunized with Freund's complete adjuvant
      followed by administration of IL-21R.Fc at the peak of inflammation in the
      joints. Rats were assessed daily for histologic features and for scoring
      of arthritis severity. In addition, the effects of IL-21R.Fc on the
      production of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) by T cells were examined.
      RESULTS: Treatment of DBA/1 mice with IL-21R.Fc reduced the clinical and
      histologic signs of collagen-induced arthritis. Nonspecific IgG1 levels
      were decreased in response to treatment. The levels of IL-6 mRNA in the
      paws and the serum IL-6 levels were decreased after treatment with
      IL-21R.Fc. IFNgamma mRNA levels were increased in the paws, and the
      addition of IL-21R.Fc to collagen-activated lymph node cultures enhanced
      the levels of IFNgamma. Collagen-specific spleen cell responses in
      IL-21R.Fc-treated mice were observed as reduced levels of IFNgamma and
      increased levels of IL-6. Treatment of Lewis rats with IL-21R.Fc after
      induction of adjuvant-induced arthritis resulted in reversal of disease
      signs and improvements in histologic parameters. CONCLUSION: These
      findings demonstrate a pathogenic role for IL-21 in animal models of RA,
      and support consideration of IL-21 as a therapeutic target in human RA.

TI  - Modulation of autoimmunity by the latest interleukins (with special
      emphasis on IL-32).
PG  - 131-7
AB  - Interleukins (IL) and other cytokines display a number of overlapping
      abilities to stimulate cells of various lineages and differentiation
      stages. Most notably, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6,
      IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, IL-25, IL-25, IL-31 and IL-32 contribute in
      concert to pathophysiological events. These include cell death,
      inflammation, allergy and autoimmunity. Up-regulation of either T helper
      (TH)1 or TH2 cells is pathogenic, and these subsets downregulate each
      other. The expression of chemokines/cytokines by endothelial cells is also
      crucial to autoimmunity by trafficking inflammatory T cells into the
      central-nervous system. IL-32 (previously termed NK transcript 4), is the
      newest inflammatory cytokine produced by mitogen-activated lymphocytes,
      interferon-gamma activated epithelial cells and IL-12, IL-18 and
      IL-32-activated NK cells. This induces TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and 2
      C-X-C chemokine family members involved in several autoimmune diseases. In
      addition, IL-32 activates arachidonic acid metabolism in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells by stimulating the release of prostaglandins. Discovery
      of this supplementary inflammatory cytokine further complicates the
      network of inflammation.

TI  - New aspects on inflammation in allergic diseases.
PG  - 156-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic disease has currently reached epidemic proportions,
      with a high percentage of individuals in the developed world exhibiting an
      allergic response after exposure to some common environmental factors.
      Although new strategies for the treatment and management of allergic
      diseases have decreased the mortality rate, a high percentage of affected
      persons still require frequent hospitalization and experience decreased
      quality of life. METHODS: An internet-based literature search was
      performed for recent contributions on the underlying mechanisms provoking
      an allergic response and their potential for therapeutic approaches.
      RESULTS: Novel concepts on allergic responses have emerged: allergic
      disease may result from an imbalance between allergen activation of
      regulatory T cells and effector T helper 2 cells (Th2), a process in which
      dendritic cells are key players. Cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6,
      IL-21, IL-25, and human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) seem to be
      important contributors in allergic processes. New data on IgE effector
      responses and on the IgE-independent mechanisms involved in allergic
      reactions have resolved some unanswered questions about these reactions.
      CONCLUSIONS: These new findings on allergic diseases have important
      implications for diagnosis and management, with potential improvements in
      prevention and treatment, which could provide a cure in the future.

TI  - The pathophysiologic rationale for biological therapies in inflammatory
      bowel disease.
PG  - 431-7
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease is driven by an excessive
      immune response in the gut wall. This review summarises important new
      developments in understanding this immune response and the downstream
      mechanisms of intestinal injury, alongside their potential role in opening
      up new avenues of treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The evidence continues to
      accumulate that Crohn's disease is primarily due to a T helper cell-type 1
      immune response in the gut wall. IL-12 and IL-18 appear to be the
      cytokines primarily responsible for Th1 polarisation, but IL-21 may also
      be important. The p40 chain of IL-12 also associates with a novel p19
      chain to form IL-23 which is also a potent Th1-inducing cytokine but the
      expression of IL-23 in Crohn's disease has not been reported. Progress in
      understanding the immunology of ulcerative colitis remains slow, but IL-13
      produced by natural killer T cells may be involved. T-cell resistance to
      apoptosis occurs in Crohn's disease, and human and mouse studies indicate
      that the signalling molecule STAT3, which transduces signals from IL-6 and
      IL-10, is involved in mucosal T cell homeostasis. Fibroblasts and
      metalloproteinases continue be implicated in ulceration, fibrosis, and
      fistula formation. SUMMARY: Understanding the immunology of inflammatory
      bowel disease continues to underpin the vast majority of new therapies and
      identifies new targets. Novel approaches, such as exploiting the
      antiinflammatory role of cannabinoid receptors, may also prove productive
      in the future.
