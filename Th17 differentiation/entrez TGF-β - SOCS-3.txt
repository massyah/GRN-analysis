TI  - Dichotomous response to TGF-beta after TCR activation by naive CD4(+) T
      cells from DBA/1 mice: Enhanced RORgammat yet reduced Foxp3 expression.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: To investigate the molecular mechanism for biased interleukin
      (IL-17) production by DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) and
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta stimulation. METHODS:: Purified
      naive CD4(+) T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 under Th1, Th2,
      Th17 and inducible T regulatory (iTreg) conditions. Cytokine production
      was assayed by intracellular staining and ELISA. Expression of
      transcription factors were determined by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and
      immunoblotting. RESULTS:: Naive CD4(+) T cells from DBA/1 mice produced
      more IL-17 under Th17 conditions compared to C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice.
      Further investigation revealed no difference amongst strains in CD4(+) T
      cell survival, upstream TCR signaling and CD69 expression; phosphorylation
      of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 and
      expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 that positively or
      negatively regulate IL-17 production. However, DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells
      expressed increased levels of retinoic acid receptor related orphan
      nuclear receptor (ROR)-gammat. Furthermore, under iTreg polarizing
      condition, DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells showed a strikingly reduced Foxp3
      expression. When interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-4 were blocked, Foxp3
      expression increased but remained lower in DBA/1 CD4(+) T cells following
      exposure to TGF-beta compared to B6 CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, DBA/1 CD4(+)
      T cells showed reduced phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 in both Th17 and
      iTreg conditions. CONCLUSION:: These results indicate that naive DBA/1
      CD4(+) T cells have a dichotomous response to TGF-beta: enhanced RORgammat
      yet reduced Foxp3 up-regulation. This observation may help elucidate the
      branch point of TGF-beta signaling leading to skewed Th17, but reduced
      iTreg differentiation.

TI  - Noradrenaline acting at central beta-adrenoceptors induces interleukin-10
      and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 expression in rat brain:
      implications for neurodegeneration.
PG  - 660-71
AB  - Evidence indicates that the monoamine neurotransmitter noradrenaline
      elicits anti-inflammatory actions in the central nervous system (CNS), and
      consequently may play a neuroprotective role where inflammatory events
      contribute to CNS pathology. Here we examined the ability of
      pharmacologically enhancing central noradrenergic tone to induce
      expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in rat brain. Administration of
      the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine (15mg/kg; ip) combined
      with the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (1mg/kg; ip) induced
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression in rat cortex and hippocampus. In
      addition, these drug treatments induced IL-10 signaling as indicated by
      increased STAT3 phosphorylation and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3
      (SOCS-3) mRNA expression. In contrast to the profound increase in IL-10
      induced by the reboxetine/idazoxan combination, the other two broad
      spectrum anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and TGF-beta were not induced by
      this treatment. The ability of combined treatment with reboxetine and
      idazoxan to induce IL-10 and SOCS3 expression was mediated by
      beta-adrenoceptor activation, as their induction was blocked by
      pre-treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Moreover,
      administration of the brain penetrant beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist
      clenbuterol induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in central IL-10
      and SOCS3 expression, and the ability of clenbuterol to induce IL-10 and
      SOCS-3 expression was blocked by the centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor
      antagonist, propranolol, and was mimicked by the highly selective
      beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol. In all, these data indicate that
      increasing central noradrenergic tone induces IL-10 production and
      signaling in the CNS, which may protect against neurodegeneration.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-{beta} coordinately induces suppressor of
      cytokine signaling 3 and leukemia inhibitory factor to suppress osteoclast
      apoptosis.
PG  - 1713-22
AB  - Local release of TGF-beta during times of high bone turnover leads to
      elevated levels within the bone microenvironment, and we have shown that
      TGF-beta suppresses osteoclast apoptosis. Therefore, understanding the
      influences of TGF-beta on bone resorbing osteoclasts is critical to the
      design of therapies to reduce excess bone loss. Here we investigated the
      mechanisms by which TGF-beta sustains suppression of osteoclast apoptosis.
      We found TGF-beta rapidly increased leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
      expression and secretion by phosphorylated mothers against
      decapentaplegic-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. TGF-beta
      also induced suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression, which
      was required for TGF-beta or LIF to promote osteoclast survival by.
      Blocking LIF or SOCS3 blocked TGF-beta promotion of osteoclast survival,
      confirming that LIF and SOCS3 expression are necessary for
      TGF-beta-mediated suppression of osteoclast apoptosis. Investigation of
      the mechanisms by which LIF promotes osteoclast survival revealed that
      LIF-induced expression of Bcl-X(L) and repressed Bcl-2 interacting domain
      expression by activating MAPK kinase, AKT, and nuclear factor-kappaB
      pathways. Suppression of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
      transcription signaling further increased Bcl-X(L) expression and enhanced
      osteoclast survival, supporting that this pathway is not involved in
      prosurvival effects of TGF-beta and LIF. These data show that TGF-beta
      coordinately induces LIF and SOCS3 to promote prosurvival signaling. This
      alters the ratio of prosurvival Bcl2 family member Bcl-X(L) to
      proapoptotic family member Bcl-2 interacting domain, leading to prolonged
      osteoclast survival.

TI  - Flt3-Ligand Decreases Th17 Cells and SOCS Proteins in the Lung of House
      Dust Mite-sensitized and Challenged Mice.
AB  - We previously reported that Flt3-L reversed airway hyper-responsiveness
      (AHR) and airway inflammation, increased the number of regulatory
      CD11c(high)CD8alpha(high)CD11b(low) dendritic cells and
      CD4+CD25+ICOS+Foxp3+IL-10+ T-regulatory cells in the lung of
      allergen-sensitized and challenged mice. In this study, we evaluated the
      effect of Flt3-L on Th17 cells and expression of SOCS proteins in the
      lungs of house dust mite (HDM)-sensitized and challenged mice. BALB/c mice
      were sensitized and challenged with HDM and AHR to methacholine was
      established. Mice were treated with Flt3-L (5 mug, i.p.) daily for 10
      days. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and TGF-beta in the BALF
      were examined by ELISA. Flt3-L treatment reversed existing AHR to
      methacholine and substantially decreased eosinophils, neutrophils, IL-5,
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-13 and TGF-beta levels in the BALF. HDM-sensitized and
      challenged mice showed a significant increase in lung
      CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+CD25- T-cells with high expression of ROR-gammat
      transcripts. However, administration of Flt3-L substantially decreased the
      number of lung CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+CD25- T-cells with significantly decreased
      expression of ROR-gammat mRNA in these cells. HDM sensitization caused a
      significant increase in the expression of SOCS-1, -3 and -5 in the lung.
      Flt3-L treatment abolished the increase in SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 protein,
      whereas SOCS-5 expression was significantly reduced. These data suggest
      that the therapeutic effect of Flt3-L in reversing the hallmarks of
      allergic asthma in a mouse model is mediated by decreasing IL-6 and
      TGF-beta levels in the BALF, which in turn decrease
      CD4+IL-17+IL-23R+ROR-gammat+CD25- T-cells and the expression of SOCS-1 and
      SOCS-3 in the lung of HDM-sensitized and challenged mice.

TI  - Epithelial overexpression of SOCS-3 in transgenic mice exacerbates wound
      inflammation in the presence of elevated TGF-beta1.
PG  - 866-75
AB  - The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 has been shown to impair
      proliferation and migration of keratinocytes. To assess the functional
      dependency among wound inflammation, SOCS-3 induction in keratinocytes,
      and the outcome of healing, we generated a transgenic mouse that
      specifically overexpresses SOCS-3 in keratinocytes. Acute wound healing in
      transgenic mice was severely impaired. Keratinocyte-specific
      overexpression of SOCS-3 led to atrophied wound-margin epithelia and
      augmented the inflammatory response of wound keratinocytes by an increase
      in chemokine (MIP-2) and inflammatory enzyme (COX-2 and iNOS) expression.
      In addition, wound tissue of transgenic mice showed a prolonged
      persistence of neutrophils and macrophages. Remarkably, impaired wounds
      showed elevated levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, which
      appeared to interfere with healing, as its neutralization markedly
      improved wound closure in transgenic mice. Interestingly, administration
      of a TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody increased wound inflammation in
      nontransgenic mice but not in transgenic littermates. This study suggests
      that SOCS-3-driven disturbances in wound keratinocytes are sufficient to
      induce inflamed wound conditions that resemble characteristics of chronic
      wounds in mice.

TI  - Diminished expression of ICOS, GITR and CTLA-4 at the mRNA level in T
      regulatory cells of children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 361-70
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases in children.
      T regulatory cells (Tregs) modulate response to autoantigens and probably
      play a role in pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The aim of the
      present study was the assessment of T regulatory cells including their
      percentages and expression of critical genes in these cells in children
      with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The examined group consisted of 50
      children with T1DM. A flow cytometric analysis of T-cell subpopulations
      was performed using the following markers: anti-CD4, anti-CD25 and
      anti-CD127 (=IL-7R). Additionally, T regulatory cells were isolated for
      assessment of mRNA levels for chosen genes with the real-time RT-PCR
      technique. The percentages of CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(dim/-) were very low
      and did not differ between T1DM and control children. We did not observe
      any statistically significant differences between healthy and diabetic
      children in mRNA expression for FoxP3, IL-7R (CD127), IL-8RA, IL-10RA,
      IL-12A, IL-2RA (CD25), IL-21, STAT1, STAT3, SOCS2, SOCS3, TGF-beta1-R1,
      TGF-beta-R2 and TBX-21 genes. Interestingly the mRNA level for CTLA-4,
      ICOS1, IL-23, IL-27, SMAD3 and GITR were lower in Treg cells of children
      with diabetes compared to the control patients. No disturbances in the
      percentages of T regulatory cells in patients with diabetes but diminished
      expression of some elements important in Treg function could be the result
      of an immunologic imbalance accompanying the onset of the diabetes. The
      results of our study should be used in future research in the field of
      immunotherapy in pediatric diabetes.

TI  - TGF-beta promotes Th17 cell development through inhibition of SOCS3.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - TGF-beta, together with IL-6 and IL-21, promotes Th17 cell development.
      IL-6 and IL-21 induce activation of STAT3, which is crucial for Th17 cell
      differentiation, as well as the expression of suppressor of cytokine
      signaling (SOCS)3, a major negative feedback regulator of STAT3-activating
      cytokines that negatively regulates Th17 cells. However, it is still
      largely unclear how TGF-beta regulates Th17 cell development and which
      TGF-beta signaling pathway is involved in Th17 cell development. In this
      report, we demonstrate that TGF-beta inhibits IL-6- and IL-21-induced
      SOCS3 expression, thus enhancing as well as prolonging STAT3 activation in
      naive CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells. TGF-beta inhibits IL-6-induced SOCS3 promoter
      activity in T cells. Also, SOCS3 small interfering RNA knockdown partially
      compensates for the action of TGF-beta on Th17 cell development. In mice
      with a dominant-negative form of TGF-beta receptor II and impaired
      TGF-beta signaling, IL-6-induced CD4(+) T cell expression of SOCS3 is
      higher whereas STAT3 activation is lower compared with wild-type B6 CD4(+)
      T cells. The addition of a TGF-beta receptor I kinase inhibitor that
      blocks Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling greatly, but not completely,
      abrogates the effect of TGF-beta on Th17 cell differentiation. Our data
      indicate that inhibition of SOCS3 and, thus, enhancement of STAT3
      activation is at least one of the mechanisms of TGF-beta promotion of Th17
      cell development.

TI  - Expression of JAKs/STATs pathway molecules in rat model of rapid focal
      segmental glomerulosclerosis.
PG  - 1661-71
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the Janus
      kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAKs/STATs)
      pathway in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Sixty specific
      pathogen-free male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: a
      model group (MG) and a control group (CG). In the MG group, nephropathy
      was induced by unilateral nephrectomy and a single tail vein injection of
      adriamycin (5 mg/kg). Ten rats were sacrificed every 2 weeks in each
      group. The expressions of smooth muscle alpha actin (alpha-SMA), collagen
      (COL)-IV, STAT1, and STAT3 were examined using histochemical techniques,
      and Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of STAT1,
      STAT3, phosphorylated (P)-STAT1, P-STAT3, and transforming growth factor
      beta1 (TGFbeta(1)). The expressions of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3,
      suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1, SOCS3, protein inhibitors of
      activated STAT (PIAS)1, and PIAS3 were also measured by real-time
      quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. A steady and significant increase
      in the expressions of alpha-SMA, COL-IV and TGFbeta(1) were observed in MG
      rats over the whole experimental course. Increased STAT1 and P-STAT1
      levels in MG rats were observed by week 6, whereas increased levels of
      STAT3 and P-STAT3 were noted by week 2. At the mRNA levels, JAK1, STAT1,
      and PIAS1 were significantly increased in MG rats in week 2, whereas JAK2
      mRNA showed a significant decrease by weeks 2 and 4, followed by an
      significant increase in week 6. Significantly increased STAT3 levels were
      noted in week 2, followed by a steady and significant decrease in weeks 4
      and 6. Significantly reduced levels of SOCS1, SOCS3, and PIAS3 mRNA were
      noted at all time points. We conclude that the JAKs/STATs signaling
      pathway may play an important role in the pathological process of rapid
      focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the rat model.

TI  - IRF4 is essential for IL-21-mediated induction, amplification, and
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype.
PG  - 20846-51
AB  - Differentiation of murine T-helper (Th) 17 cells is induced by antigenic
      stimulation and the sequential action of the cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and
      IL-23, along with TGFbeta. Current dogma proposes that IL-6 induces IL-21,
      which, in a STAT3-dependent manner, amplifies its own transcription,
      contributes to IL-17 production, and, moreover, promotes the expression of
      the IL-23 receptor. This, in turn, prepares cells for IL-23-mediated
      stabilization of the Th17 phenotype. Here we demonstrate that these
      effects of IL-21 on Th17 differentiation are completely dependent on IFN
      regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). After culturing in the presence of IL-21 plus
      TGFbeta, IRF4-deficient (Irf4(-/-)) Th cells showed a profound intrinsic
      defect in IL-17 production and in the autocrine IL-21 loop. Likewise, the
      levels of IL-23 receptor and the lineage-specific orphan nuclear receptors
      RORalpha and RORgammat were diminished, whereas the T regulatory (Treg)
      transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) was strongly up-regulated,
      consistent with the reciprocal relationship between Th17 and Treg
      development. Despite this loss of IL-21 functions, IL-21-induced STAT3
      activation was unimpaired and induced normal Socs3 expression. Forced
      expression of Foxp3 in WT cells inhibited IL-21-mediated IL-17 production,
      suggesting that the increase in Foxp3 contributes to the Irf4(-/-)
      phenotype. Additionally, the low levels of RORalpha and RORgammat are also
      partially responsible, because simultaneous overexpression of both
      proteins restored IL-17 production in Irf4(-/-) cells to some extent.
      These data highlight IRF4 as a decisive factor during the IL-21-mediated
      steps of Th17 development by influencing the balance of Foxp3, RORalpha,
      and RORgammat.

TI  - Effect of leptin on mouse trophoblast giant cells.
PG  - 415-24
AB  - Leptin plays a role in both energy homeostasis and reproduction, and it is
      required in early pregnancy. It stimulates metalloproteinase activity in
      cultured human trophoblasts and invasiveness of cultured mouse
      trophoblasts. Our goal has been to examine mechanisms that underpin the
      ability of leptin to promote trophoblast invasiveness in primary cultures
      of mouse trophoblasts. Leptin stimulated the phosphorylation of MEK
      (MAP2K1) but not signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
      (STAT3) in the cultures, increased the concentration of the suppressor of
      cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) protein, and upregulated metalloproteinase
      activity. Microarray analysis revealed that leptin stimulated select genes
      with roles in cell motility, including Stmn, a gene linked to invasiveness
      in other cell types. There was also an increase in activity of several
      genes associated with MAPK and RhoGTPase signaling. In addition, leptin
      muted expression of genes correlated with terminal differentiation of
      trophoblast giant cells, including ones associated with the TGFbeta
      signaling pathway and endoreduplication of DNA, and upregulated selected
      prolactin-related family members. Feulgen staining of leptin-treated cells
      revealed a loss of cells with low ploidy. The data suggest that leptin
      accelerates disappearance of non-giant cells while inhibiting terminal
      differentiation of committed giant cells, possibly by maintaining cells in
      an intermediate stage of differentiation.

TI  - Reduced nitric oxide production and iNOS mRNA expression in
      IFN-gamma-stimulated chicken macrophages transfected with iNOS siRNAs.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - Utilizing RNA interference technology with siRNA in the HD11 macrophage
      cell line, we determined how the inhibition or knock-down of the iNOS
      (inducible nitric oxide synthase) gene affected IFN-gamma-induced
      macrophage production of nitric oxide (NO) and mRNA expression of genes
      involved in this biological pathway in the chicken. Chicken macrophages
      produce NO when stimulated with recombinant chicken IFN-gamma, however,
      when transfected with iNOS siRNAs, the production of NO is significantly
      decreased. We observed a 14-28% reduction in NO production by
      IFN-gamma-stimulated HD11 cells at 48h after initial siRNA transfection
      compared to non-transfected IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages. Significant
      knock-down of iNOS mRNA expression (15 to 50-fold lower) was observed for
      each of four iNOS siRNAs, when compared to non-transfected
      IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages and to those treated with a negative
      control siRNA. The IFN-gamma-stimulated chicken macrophages transfected
      with iNOS siRNAs did not show altered levels of mRNA expression for genes
      involved in IFN-gamma signaling and iNOS pathways (IL-1beta, IL-6,
      IFN-gamma, TGF-beta4, or SOCS-3) suggesting that the observed decrease in
      NO production is a direct result of siRNA mediated knock-down of iNOS,
      rather than IFN-gamma-induced changes in the other genes tested.

TI  - Loss of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 in helper T cells leads to
      defective Th17 differentiation by enhancing antagonistic effects of
      IFN-gamma on STAT3 and Smads.
PG  - 3746-56
AB  - Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is an important negative
      regulator for cytokines; however, the role of SOCS1 in Th17
      differentiation has not been clarified. We generated T cell-specific
      SOCS1-deficient mice and found that these mice were extremely resistant to
      a Th17-dependent autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis. SOCS1-deficient naive CD4(+) T cells were predominantly
      differentiated into Th1 and poorly into Th17 in vitro. These phenotypes
      were canceled in IFN-gamma(-/-) background, suggesting that a large amount
      of IFN-gamma in SOCS1-deficient T cells suppressed Th17 differentiation.
      IL-6 plus TGF-beta enhanced retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor
      (ROR)-gammat expression and suppressed IFN-gamma production in wild-type T
      cells, whereas these effects were severely impaired in SOCS1-deficient T
      cells. These phenotypes can be partly explained by STAT3 suppression by
      enhanced SOCS3 induction through hyper-STAT1 activation in SOCS1-deficient
      T cells. In addition, SOCS1-deficient T cells were much less sensitive to
      TGF-beta. Suppression of Th1 differentiation by TGF-beta was impaired in
      SOCS1-deficient T cells. TGF-beta-mediated Smad transcriptional activity
      was severely inhibited in SOCS1-deficient cells in the presence of
      IFN-gamma. Such impairment of TGF-beta functions were not observed in
      SOCS3-overexpressed cells, indicating that suppression of Smads was
      independent of SOCS3. Therefore, SOCS1 is necessary for Th17
      differentiation by suppressing antagonistic effect of IFN-gamma on both
      STAT3 and Smads. Induction of SOCS3 can partly explain IFN-gamma-mediated
      STAT3 suppression, while other mechanism(s) will be involved in
      IFN-gamma-mediated Smad suppression. SOCS1-deficient T cells will be very
      useful to investigate the molecular mechanism for the STAT1-mediated
      suppression of Th17 development.

TI  - Gene expression analysis of BCR/ABL1-dependent transcriptional response
      reveals enrichment for genes involved in negative feedback regulation.
PG  - 267-75
AB  - Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive leukemia is characterized by the
      BCR/ABL1 fusion protein that affects a wide range of signal transduction
      pathways. The knowledge about its downstream target genes is, however,
      still quite limited. To identify novel BCR/ABL1-regulated genes we used
      global gene expression profiling of several Ph-positive and Ph-negative
      cell lines treated with imatinib. Following imatinib treatment, the
      Ph-positive cells showed decreased growth, viability, and reduced
      phosphorylation of BCR/ABL1 and STAT5. In total, 142 genes were identified
      as being dependent on BCR/ABL1-mediated signaling, mainly including genes
      involved in signal transduction, e.g. the JAK/STAT, MAPK, TGFB, and
      insulin signaling pathways, and in regulation of metabolism.
      Interestingly, BCR/ABL1 was found to activate several genes involved in
      negative feedback regulation (CISH, SOCS2, SOCS3, PIM1, DUSP6, and
      TNFAIP3), which may act to indirectly suppress the tumor promoting effects
      exerted by BCR/ABL1. In addition, several genes identified as deregulated
      upon BCR/ABL1 expression could be assigned to the TGFB and NFkB signaling
      pathways, as well as to reflect the metabolic adjustments needed for
      rapidly growing cells. Apart from providing important pathogenetic
      insights into BCR/ABL1-mediated leukemogenesis, the present study also
      provides a number of pathways/individual genes that may provide attractive
      targets for future development of targeted therapies. This article
      contains Supplementary Material available at

AB  - Th17(T helper 17 cell), a newly discovered subset of T cells is associated
      with IL-23 and characterized by production of IL-17, the functions of
      which are distinct from those of Th1, Th2 and Treg subsets. The
      development of Th17 cells can be promoted by TGF-beta1, IL-6, and IL-23;
      but inhibited by IFN-gamma, IL-4 and Socs3. It is clear that Th17 cells
      have protective effects on body by facilitating the pro-inflammatory
      responses. On the other hand, the role of Th17 cells in the
      pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases has been described.

TI  - SOCS 3 and PPAR-gamma ligands inhibit the expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta1
      by regulating JAK2/STAT3 signaling in pancreas.
PG  - 677-88
AB  - Induction of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TGF-beta1 are the hallmark
      of human pancreatitis. Cerulein pancreatitis is similar to human edematous
      pancreatitis involving dysregulation of digestive enzyme production,
      cytoplasmic vacuolization, and increased cytokine production. We
      previously showed that cerulein induced IL-1beta expression through the
      Janus kinase (JAK) 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (STAT) 3 pathway in pancreatic acinar cells. Suppressor of cytokine
      signaling (SOCS) is a negative feedback regulator of JAK/STAT signaling.
      In this study, we demonstrate that SOCS 3 is induced by cerulein in
      pancreatic acinar AR42J cells and in the rat pancreas. In both AR42J cells
      and rat pancreas, cerulein induced expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta1, which
      is enhanced by transfection or injection of SOCS 3 antisense
      oligonucleotide (AS ODN). Pre-treating cerulein-stimulated AR42J cells or
      rats with the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma
      (PPAR-gamma) ligands, 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone, induced SOCS 3 expression
      and inhibited JAK2/STAT3 activation. This treatment regimen also inhibited
      IL-6 and TGF-beta1 induction, vacuolization, and alpha-smooth muscle actin
      (alpha-SMA) expression. Thus, SOCS 3 expression is associated with a
      reduction in IL-6 and TGF-beta1 expression, edema formation,
      vacuolization, and alpha-SMA expression, possibly by direct regulation of
      JAK2/STAT3 signaling. 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone are potentially useful
      pancreatitis therapies by suppressing the JAK2/STAT3 inflammatory
      signaling through SOCS 3 induction.

TI  - SOCS3 promotes TLR4 response in macrophages by feedback inhibiting
      TGF-beta1/Smad3 signaling.
PG  - 1405-13
AB  - Endogenous transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays an important
      role in the negative regulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in a
      feedback manner. Suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) has been
      shown to be induced by TGF-beta1 in osteoclast/macrophage, while the
      reports on the role of SOCS3 in regulating TLR4 signaling were
      controversial. The functional relationship between SOCS3 and
      TGF-beta1/Smad3 pathway in TLR4 response also remains unclear. In this
      study, we demonstrate that LPS-induced endogenous TGF-beta1 contributes to
      the inducible SOCS3 expression in macrophages. SOCS3 silencing could
      markedly decrease the LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in
      macrophages. Interestingly, less decrease of LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6
      by SOCS3 silencing was observed in Smad3 null macrophages. Furthermore, we
      found SOCS3 could interact with Smad3, and inhibit Smad3 nuclear
      translocation and transcriptional activity. Therefore, our data
      demonstrate that SOCS3 is a positive regulator of TLR4 response by
      feedback inhibiting endogenous TGF-beta1/Smad3 signaling, thus outlining a
      new feedback regulatory manner for TLR4 response in macrophages.

TI  - Selective expansion of foxp3-positive regulatory T cells and
      immunosuppression by suppressors of cytokine signaling 3-deficient
      dendritic cells.
PG  - 2170-9
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) induce immunity and immunological tolerance as APCs.
      It has been shown that DCs secreting IL-10 induce IL-10(+) Tr1-type
      regulatory T (Treg) cells, whereas Foxp3-positive Treg cells are expanded
      from naive CD4(+) T cells by coculturing with mature DCs. However, the
      regulatory mechanism of expansion of Foxp3(+) Treg cells by DCs has not
      been clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that suppressors of
      cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3-deficient DCs have a strong potential as
      Foxp3(+) T cell-inducing tolerogenic DCs. SOCS3(-/-) DCs expressed lower
      levels of class II MHC, CD40, CD86, and IL-12 than wild-type (WT)-DCs both
      in vitro and in vivo, and showed constitutive activation of STAT3.
      Foxp3(-) effector T cells were predominantly expanded by the priming with
      WT-DCs, whereas Foxp3(+) Treg cells were selectively expanded by
      SOCS3(-/-) DCs. Adoptive transfer of SOCS3(-/-) DCs reduced the severity
      of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Foxp3(+) T cell expansion
      was blocked by anti-TGF-beta Ab, and SOCS3(-/-) DCs produced higher levels
      of TGF-beta than WT-DCs, suggesting that TGF-beta plays an essential role
      in the expansion of Foxp3(+) Treg cells. These results indicate an
      important role of SOCS3 in determining on immunity or tolerance by DCs.

TI  - Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) limits damage-induced crypt
      hyper-proliferation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis in the
      colon.
PG  - 4833-41
AB  - Intestinal injury or chronic inflammation induce cytokines that promote
      crypt regeneration and mucosal repair. If excessive or prolonged, such
      mechanisms may increase colon cancer risk. Factors that terminate or limit
      cytokine action in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) may protect against
      crypt hyperplasia and neoplasia. We hypothesized that suppressor of
      cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is such a factor. Mice with
      Vilin-promoter/Cre-recombinase (VC)-mediated IEC-specific SOCS3 gene
      disruption (VC/HO), WT/HO littermates with floxed but intact SOCS3 genes
      and VC/WT mice were studied. Colon was examined after acute dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS)-induced mucosal injury or after azoxymethane (AOM) and
      chronic DSS. Signaling pathways were examined in colon, cultured IEC or
      colon cancer cell lines. VC/HO mice showed no basal phenotype. After acute
      DSS, VC/HO exhibited enhanced crypt proliferation and crypt hyperplasia
      and reduced transforming growth factor (TGF) beta expression in colon.
      Inflammation and mucosal damage were similar across genotypes. Following
      AOM/DSS, VC/HO mice had increased size, number and load of colonic tumors
      and increased STAT3 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation in
      colon. In vitro, SOCS3 overexpression reduced proliferation, IL-6-mediated
      STAT3 activation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-mediated NF-kappaB
      activation. We conclude that cytokine induction of SOCS3 normally provides
      an intrinsic mechanism to limit injury-induced crypt hyperproliferation
      and inflammation-associated colon cancer by regulating both STAT3 and
      NF-kappaB pathways.

TI  - Conditional mutagenesis reveals immunological functions of widely
      expressed genes: activation thresholds, homeostatic mechanisms and disease
      models.
PG  - 289-314
AB  - Evolutionarily conserved, widely expressed genes provide the functional
      backbone of most, if not all, cell types. Although mouse mutants created
      by germ line gene inactivation are instrumental in establishing the
      importance of such genes in vivo, distortion of embryonic development or
      multiple body systems often preclude detailed functional studies. To
      overcome this limitation, DNA recombination systems such as Cre/loxP of
      bacteriophage P1, have been adapted for use in mammalian cells. The
      mutagenic event is restricted to the tissue or cell type in question
      leaving other body systems undisturbed. Conditional inactivation of Csk or
      Socs3, for example, established their key role in the prevention of
      inappropriate inflammation, while unexpected immunoregulatory activities
      emerged from studies of the NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways. Also, cell types
      responsible for protective or pathogenic TNFalpha production have been
      identified. Inactivation of immunoregulatory receptors in leukocyte
      subsets can provide robust experimental systems revealing the conceptual
      simplicity underlying the modulation of complex signaling pathways during
      homeostatic responses. As illustrated for TGF-beta receptor, such
      system-guided approaches can provide a comprehensive picture of the
      regulatory events driving in vivo phenotype and specific responses of
      primary cells. This in turn facilitates the identification of novel
      regulatory mechanisms, targets for therapeutic intervention and prediction
      of side effects. With the increasing evidence for a role of somatic
      mutations in a wider range of human diseases, conditional mouse models are
      set to play a continuing part in the identification of pathogenic
      mechanisms for restoration of normal cellular processes in diseases
      including cancer, inflammation and autoimmunity.

TI  - Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment modulates the disease course in
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - Treatment with the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS) prior to the
      induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) consistently
      led to a delayed onset of disease but not to a reduction in disease
      severity. T cell proliferation was reduced in LPS-treated mice, due at
      least in part to a loss in antigen presenting cell function. T cell and
      macrophage infiltration into the CNS was delayed and TNFalpha production
      was diminished in LPS pre-treated mice, consistent with the delay in
      disease onset. Real-time PCR analysis of gene expression in the CNS of LPS
      or saline pre-treated mice demonstrated an early induction of TNFalpha,
      TGFbeta, IFNbeta, and SOCS3 in the LPS pre-treated mice. Thus, exposure to
      LPS prior to EAE induction affects antigen presentation and may modulate
      the expression of inflammatory regulators that impact the autoimmune
      disease course.

TI  - Loss of SOCS3 in T helper cells resulted in reduced immune responses and
      hyperproduction of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor-beta 1.
PG  - 1021-31
AB  - Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 is a major negative feedback
      regulator of signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (STAT)3-activating cytokines. Transgenic mouse studies indicate that high
      levels of SOCS3 in T cells result in type 2 T helper cell (Th2) skewing
      and lead to hypersensitivity to allergic diseases. To define the
      physiological roles of SOCS3 in T cells, we generated T cell-specific
      SOCS3 conditional knockout mice. We found that the mice lacking SOCS3 in T
      cells showed reduced immune responses not only to ovalbumin-induced airway
      hyperresponsiveness but also to Leishmania major infection. In vitro,
      SOCS3-deficient CD4+ T cells produced more transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-beta1 and interleukin (IL)-10, but less IL-4 than control T cells,
      suggesting preferential Th3-like differentiation. We found that STAT3
      positively regulates TGF-beta1 promoter activity depending on the
      potential STAT3 binding sites. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation
      assay revealed that more STAT3 was recruited to the TGF-beta1 promoter in
      SOCS3-deficient T cells than in control T cells. The activated STAT3
      enhanced TGF-beta1 and IL-10 expression in T cells, whereas the
      dominant-negative form of STAT3 suppressed these. From these findings, we
      propose that SOCS3 regulates the production of the immunoregulatory
      cytokines TGF-beta1 and IL-10 through modulating STAT3 activation.

TI  - Suppressor of cytokine Signaling-3 inhibits interleukin-1 signaling by
      targeting the TRAF-6/TAK1 complex.
PG  - 1587-96
AB  - IL-1 plays a major role in inflammation and autoimmunity through
      activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) and MAPKs. Although a
      great deal is known about the mechanism of activation of NFkappaB and
      MAPKs by IL-1, much less is known about the down-regulation of this
      pathway. Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 was shown to inhibit
      IL-1-induced transcription and activation of NFkappaB and the MAPKs JNK
      and p38, but the mechanism is unknown. We show here that SOCS-3 inhibits
      NFkappaB-dependent transcription induced by overexpression of the upstream
      IL-1 signaling molecules MyD88, IL-1R-activated kinase 1, TNF
      receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6, and TGFbeta-activated kinase (TAK)1,
      but not when the MAP3K MAPK/ERK kinase kinase-1 is used instead of TAK1,
      indicating that the target for SOCS-3 is the TRAF6/TAK1 signaling complex.
      By coimmunoprecipitation, it was shown that SOCS-3 inhibited the
      association between TRAF6 and TAK1 and that SOCS-3 coimmunoprecipitated
      with TAK1 and TRAF6. Furthermore, SOCS-3 inhibited the IL-1-induced
      catalytic activity of TAK1. Because ubiquitination of TRAF6 is required
      for activation of TAK1, we analyzed the role of SOCS-3 on TRAF6
      ubiquitination and found that SOCS-3 inhibited ubiquitin modification of
      TRAF6. These results indicate that SOCS-3 inhibits IL-1 signal
      transduction by inhibiting ubiquitination of TRAF6, thus preventing
      association and activation of TAK1.

TI  - Loss of SOCS3 in the liver promotes fibrosis by enhancing STAT3-mediated
      TGF-beta1 production.
PG  - 2520-30
AB  - Recently, DNA methylation and reduced expression of the suppressor of the
      cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      patients have been reported. However, the roles of SOCS3 in HCC
      development in vivo have not been clarified. Using RT-PCR analysis and
      Western blotting, we confirmed that SOCS3 expression was reduced in HCC
      patients. However, reduced expression of SOCS3 occurred not only in HCC
      but also in nontumor regions, and this reduction was stronger as the
      fibrosis grade increased. Furthermore, SOCS3 levels were inversely
      correlated with signal transducers and activators of transcription-3
      (STAT3) activation as well as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1
      levels in the non-HCC region. To define the molecular consequences of
      SOCS3 silencing/STAT3 hyperactivation and liver fibrosis, we examined
      liver-specific SOCS3-deficient mice. We demonstrated that SOCS3 deletion
      in the liver resulted in hyperactivation of STAT3 and promoted ConA- and
      chemical-induced liver fibrosis. The expression of TGF-beta1, a mediator
      of fibrosis, was enhanced by SOCS3 gene deletion, but suppressed by the
      overexpression of a dominant-negative STAT3 or SOCS3 both in vivo and in
      vitro. These data suggest that TGF-beta1 is a target gene of STAT3 and
      could be one of the mechanisms for enhanced fibrosis in SOCS3-deficient
      mice. Thus, our present study provides a novel role of SOCS3 and STAT3 in
      HCC development: in addition to the previously characterized oncogenic
      potentials, STAT3 enhances hepatic fibrosis through the upregulation of
      TGF-beta1 expression, and SOCS3 prevents this process.

PG  - 1556-8
AB  - We investigated the effect of 5-FU and radiation in OK-432-induced
      cytokine production. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) with OK-432 (1 micro/ml) for 24 h induced Th1-type cytokines
      (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-18) as well as IL-10 and TGF-beta. When
      the PBMCs were stimulated by 5-FU (5 microg/ml) or X-ray (2 Gy)
      simultaneously with OK-432, production of IL-10 and TGF-beta was
      significantly inhibited, while no significant change in Th1 cytokine
      production was observed. Although OK-432 also enhanced the expression of
      the genes encoding SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, which are negative regulators for
      cytokine signaling, this was reduced by 5-FU or X-irradiation. Induction
      of IL-10 and TGF-beta by OK-432 was significantly decreased by adding
      antisense ODN for SOCS-1 or that for SOCS-3. Radiation and 5-FU induce
      Th1-dominant state by inhibiting the OK-432-induced production of IL-10
      and TGF-beta mediated by regulation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression, and
      are suggested to increase anti-cancer immunity.
