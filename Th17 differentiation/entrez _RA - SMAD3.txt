TI  - Positive and negative transcriptional regulation of the Foxp3 gene is

AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying retinoic acid (RA) augmentation of T
      cell receptor (TCR) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced
      Foxp3 transcription and inhibition of the latter by cytokines such as
      IL-27 were here shown to be related processes involving modifications of
      baseline (TGF-beta-induced) phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3) binding to a
      conserved enhancer region (enhancer I). RA augmentation involved the
      binding of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) to a
      dominant site in enhancer I and a subordinate site in the promoter. This
      led to increased histone acetylation in the region of the Smad3 binding
      site and increased binding of pSmad3. Cytokine (IL-27) inhibition involved
      binding of pStat3 to a gene silencer in a second conserved enhancer region
      (enhancer II) downstream from enhancer I; this led to loss of pSmad3
      binding to enhancer I. Thus, control of accessibility and binding of
      pSmad3 provides a common framework for positive and negative regulation of
      TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 transcription.

TI  - Transcription factor Smad3 is required for the inhibition of adipogenesis
      by retinoic acid.
PG  - 13274-84
AB  - The process of adipocyte differentiation is driven by a highly coordinated
      cascade of transcriptional events that results in the development of the
      mature adipocyte and in lipid accumulation. One of the early events of
      differentiation is the up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein
      beta (C/EBPbeta) expression. C/EBPbeta then acts to up-regulate the
      expression of adipogenic factors such as C/EBPalpha, which control the
      late stage of adipogenesis. Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent inhibitor of
      adipogenesis, and its action appears to block C/EBPbeta transcriptional
      potential early during differentiation. Using preadipocytes and
      mesenchymal stem cell models, we show that RA specifically blocks the
      occupancy of C/EBPbeta of the Cebpa promoter, thereby abrogating the
      differentiation process. RA does not act directly on C/EBPbeta but rather
      stimulates the expression of the transforming growth factor beta-effector
      protein Smad3, which can interact with C/EBPbeta via its Mad homology 1
      domain and can interfere with C/EBPbeta DNA binding. The RA-induced
      increase in Smad3 expression results in increased cytoplasmic and nuclear
      Smad3, an important event as ectopic expression of Smad3 in preadipocytes
      in the absence of RA treatment only modestly inhibits adipogenesis and
      C/EBPbeta DNA binding, suggesting that Smad3 alone is not sufficient to
      completely recapitulate the effects of retinoic acid treatment during
      differentiation. However, in the absence of Smad3, RA is not able to
      inhibit adipocyte differentiation or to elicit a decrease in C/EBPbeta DNA
      occupancy suggesting that Smad3 is necessary to convey the inhibitory
      effects of retinoic acid during adipogenesis.

TI  - Retinoic acid can enhance conversion of naive into regulatory T cells
      independently of secreted cytokines.
PG  - 2131-9
AB  - It has been reported that retinoic acid (RA) enhances regulatory T (T reg)
      cell conversion by inhibiting the secretion of cytokines that interfere
      with conversion. This report shows that these conclusions provide a
      partial explanation at best. First, RA not only interfered with cytokine
      secretion but also with the ability of these cytokines to inhibit T reg
      cell conversion of naive T cells. Furthermore, RA enhanced conversion even
      in the absence of inhibitory cytokines. The latter effect depended on the
      RA receptor alpha (RAR alpha) but did not require Smad3, despite the fact
      that RA enhanced Smad3 expression. The RAR alpha 1 isoform was not
      essential for RA-dependent enhancement of transforming growth factor
      beta-driven conversion, suggesting that conversion can also be mediated by
      RAR alpha 2. Interleukin (IL)-6 strongly reduced RAR alpha expression
      levels such that a deficiency of the predominant RAR alpha 1 isoform
      leaves too little RAR alpha 2 for RA to inhibit the generation of Th17
      cells in the presence of IL-6.

TI  - Smad2/3 is involved in growth inhibition of mouse embryonic palate
      mesenchymal cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid.
PG  - 780-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cleft palate is one of the major malformations induced by
      retinoic acid in both rodents and humans. The purpose of the present study
      was to elucidate the mechanism by which all-trans retinoic acid (atRA)
      induces the cleft palate. METHODS: The cell cycle distribution of mouse
      embryonic palate mesenchymal (MEPM) cells under atRA (100 mg/kg) treatment
      on gestation day (GD) 10 or GD 12 were measured by immunohistochemistry
      and flow cytometry. The p21, phospho-Rb, Smad2/3, phospho-Smad2 and
      phospho-Smad3 protein expression levels were detected by western blot,
      respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for p21, Smad2, and
      Smad3 gene expression in each group under both conditions. Small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) was applied to inhibit Smad2/3 expression in MEPM
      cells and the effect was detected by western blot and flow cytometry.
      RESULTS: The G(0)/G(1) arrest in MEPM cells in vivo was induced by atRA on
      GD 10. The protein expression levels of p21, Smad2/3, phospho-Smad2, and
      phospho-Smad3 were increased, while phospho-Rb was decreased in MEPM after
      atRA treatment on GD 10. These changes were not observed on the GD 12
      group. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of p21, Smad2, and Smad3
      detected by quantitative real-time PCR were almost consistent with their
      protein expression trends. Furthermore, p21 was partially decreased and
      G(0)/G(1) arrest was partially released following Smad2/3 siRNA knockdown.
      CONCLUSIONS: The induction of G(0)/G(1) block by atRA in MEPM cells varied
      with the development stage of exposure. Our study demonstrated that
      Smad2/3 regulation of p21 was partly required for atRA-induced cell cycle
      perturbations in MEPM cells.

TI  - Retinoic acid increases Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and inhibits development
      of Th17 cells by enhancing TGF-beta-driven Smad3 signaling and inhibiting
      IL-6 and IL-23 receptor expression.
PG  - 2277-84
AB  - The de novo generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the
      peripheral immune compartment and the differentiation of Th17 cells both
      require TGF-beta, and IL-6 and IL-21 are switch factors that drive the
      development of Th17 cells at the expense of Treg cell generation. The
      major vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA) not only enforces
      the generation of Treg cells but also inhibits the differentiation of Th17
      cells. Herein we show that RA enhances TGF-beta signaling by increasing
      the expression and phosphorylation of Smad3, and this results in increased
      Foxp3 expression even in the presence of IL-6 or IL-21. RA also inhibits
      the expression of IL-6Ralpha, IRF-4, and IL-23R and thus inhibits Th17
      development. In vitro, RA significantly promotes Treg cell conversion, but
      in vivo during the development of experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis it does not increase the frequency of Treg cells in the
      face of an ongoing inflammation. However, RA suppresses the disease very
      efficiently by inhibiting proinflammatory T cell responses, especially
      pathogenic Th17 responses. These data not only identify the signaling
      mechanisms by which RA can affect both Treg cell and Th17 differentiation,
      but they also highlight that in vivo during an autoimmune reaction, RA
      suppresses autoimmunity mainly by inhibiting the generation of effector
      Th17 cells.

TI  - Inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta-induced liver fibrosis by a
      retinoic acid derivative via the suppression of Col 1A2 promoter activity.
PG  - 219-23
AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mediates expression of
      collagen 1A2 (Col 1A2) gene via a synergistic cooperation between
      Smad2/Smad3 and Sp1, both act on the Col 1A2 gene promoter. In our
      previous study, we reported that a retinoic acid derivative obtained from
      Phellinus linteus (designated PL) antagonizes TGF-beta-induced liver
      fibrosis through regulation of ROS and calcium influx. In this continuing
      study we seek further the effect of PL on the Smad signaling pathway. We
      used a Col 1A2 promoter-luciferase construct to study the action of PL on
      Smad through TGF-beta. We found that PL decreases the promoter activity of
      Col 1A2, hinders the translocalization of phosphorylated Smad2/3-Smad 4
      complex from cytosol into nucleus and inhibits Sp1 binding activity. These
      results suggest that PL inhibits TGF-beta1-induced Col 1A2 promoter
      activity through blocking ROS and calcium influx as well as impeding Sp1
      binding and translocalization of pSmad 2/3-Smad4 complex into nucleus.

TI  - All-trans retinoic acid inhibited chondrogenesis of mouse embryonic palate
      mesenchymal cells by down-regulation of TGF-beta/Smad signaling.
PG  - 929-34
AB  - Chondrogenesis is a critical step in palatogenesis. All-trans retinoic
      acid (atRA), a vitamin A derivative, is a known teratogenic effector of
      cleft palate. Here, we evaluated the effects of atRA on the
      osteo-/chondrogenic differentiation of mouse embryonic palate mesenchymal
      (MEPM) cells. MEPM cells, in a high-density micromass environment, undergo
      active chondrogenesis in a manner analogous to that of limb-derived
      mesenchymal cells, and served as a valid model system to investigate the
      mechanisms regulating chondrogenesis during palatogenesis. atRA-treated
      MEPM micromass expressed relatively higher levels of osteoblastic gene
      markers (alkaline phosphatase and collagen type I) and lower levels of
      chondrocytic gene markers (collagen type II and aggrecan). As transforming
      growth factor-beta3 (TGF-beta3) is an essential growth factor for
      chondrogenesis of embryonic mesenchymal cells both in in vivo and in vitro
      conditions, we thereby explored the effects of atRA on TGF-beta3 signaling
      pathway. atRA led to an increase in mRNA expression of TGF-beta3 and an
      instantaneous decrease in TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII) as
      determined by real-time RT-PCR. Further study showed that atRA inhibited
      phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 and increased Smad7 expression.
      Activation of the Smad pathways by transfection with Smad7deltaC mutant or
      constitutively active TbetaRII retroviral vector abolished atRA-induced
      inhibition of chondrogenesis as indicated by Alcian blue staining,
      indicating that Smad signaling is essential for this response. Taken
      together, these data for the first time demonstrated a role for RA-induced
      hypochondrogenesis through regulation of the TGF-beta3 pathway and
      suggested a role for TbetaRII /Smad in retinoid-induced cleft palate.
