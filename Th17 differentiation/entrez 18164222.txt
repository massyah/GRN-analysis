TI  - T helper 17 lineage differentiation is programmed by orphan nuclear receptors ROR
      alpha and ROR gamma.
PG  - 29-39
AB  - T cell functional differentiation is mediated by lineage-specific transcription
      factors. T helper 17 (Th17) has been recently identified as a distinct Th lineage
      mediating tissue inflammation. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor
      gamma (ROR gamma) was shown to regulate Th17 differentiation; ROR gamma
      deficiency, however, did not completely abolish Th17 cytokine expression. Here,
      we report Th17 cells highly expressed another related nuclear receptor, ROR
      alpha, induced by transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which
      is dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
      Overexpression of ROR alpha promoted Th17 differentiation, possibly through the
      conserved noncoding sequence 2 in Il17-Il17f locus. ROR alpha deficiency resulted
      in reduced IL-17 expression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ROR alpha and ROR 
      gamma coexpression synergistically led to greater Th17 differentiation. Double
      deficiencies in ROR alpha and ROR gamma globally impaired Th17 generation and
      completely protected mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
      Therefore, Th17 differentiation is directed by two lineage-specific nuclear
      receptors, ROR alpha and ROR gamma.
