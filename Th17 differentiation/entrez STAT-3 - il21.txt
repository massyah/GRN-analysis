TI  - Crohn's disease: Th1, Th17 or both? The change of a paradigm: new
      immunological and genetic insights implicate Th17 cells in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1152-67
AB  - Traditionally, Crohn's disease has been associated with a Th1 cytokine
      profile, while Th2 cytokines are modulators of ulcerative colitis. This
      concept has been challenged by the description of tolerising regulatory T
      cells (Treg) and by proinflammatory Th17 cells, a novel T cell population
      characterised by the master transcription factor RORgammat, the surface
      markers IL23R and CCR6, and by production of the proinflammatory cytokines
      IL17A, IL17F, IL21, IL22 and IL26, and the chemokine CCL20. Th17 cells
      differentiate under the influence of IL1beta, IL6, IL21 and IL23. Recent
      studies indicate that TGFbeta is essential not only for the development of
      murine Th17 cells but also for differentiation of human Th17 cells.
      TGFbeta reciprocally regulates the differentiation of inflammatory Th17
      cells and suppressive Treg subsets, with the concomitant presence of
      proinflammatory cytokines favouring Th17 cell differentiation. Several
      studies demonstrated an important role of Th17 cells in intestinal
      inflammation, particularly in Crohn's disease. Genome-wide association
      studies indicate that IL23R and five additional genes involved in Th17
      differentiation (IL12B, JAK2, STAT3, CCR6 and TNFSF15) are associated with
      susceptibility to Crohn's disease and partly also to ulcerative colitis.
      Taken together, both Th1 and Th17 cells are important mediators of
      inflammation in Crohn's disease, although activities previously ascribed
      to IL12 may be mediated by IL23. Anti-IL12/IL23p40 antibody therapy, which
      targets both Th1 and Th17 cells, is effective in Crohn's disease. However,
      the complex relationship between Th1 and Th17 cells has not been
      completely analysed. This will be of great importance to delineate the
      specific contributions of these cells to Crohn's disease and other
      autoimmune diseases.

TI  - IL-21 is produced by Th17 cells and drives IL-17 production in a
      STAT3-dependent manner.
PG  - 34605-10
AB  - CD4(+) helper T cells can differentiate into several possible fates
      including: Th1, Th2, T regulatory, and Th17 cells. Although, cytokine
      production by non-T cells is an important factor in helper T cell
      differentiation, a characteristic feature of both Th1 and Th2 lineages is
      their ability to secrete cytokines that promote their respective
      differentiation. However, cytokines produced by T cells that help to
      sustain Th17 cells have not yet been identified. Here we show that IL-21
      is a product of Th17 cells, which is induced in a Stat3-dependent manner.
      Additionally, Stat3 can directly bind the Il21 promoter. IL-21 also
      induces IL-17 production and expression of the transcription factor,
      RORgammat. Furthermore, generation of Th17 cells in the conventional
      manner is attenuated by blocking IL-21. IL-21 is known to activate Stat3
      and its ability to induce Th17 differentiation is abrogated in the absence
      of Stat3. These data argue that IL-21 serves as an autocrine factor
      secreted by Th17 cells that promotes or sustains Th17 lineage commitment.
