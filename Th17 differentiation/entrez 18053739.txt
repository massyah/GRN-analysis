TI  - Transcriptional regulation of Th17 cell differentiation.
PG  - 409-17
AB  - The paradigm of effector T helper cell differentiation into either Th1 or Th2
      lineages has been profoundly shaken by the discovery of T cells that secrete
      IL-17 and other inflammatory cytokines. This subset, referred to as Th17, is
      centrally involved in autoimmune disease and is important in host defense at
      mucosal surfaces. In mouse, a series of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, 
      and TGF-beta, function sequentially or synergistically to induce the Th17
      lineage. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IFNgamma, and IL-27, inhibit
      differentiation of this lineage. Here we review how the nuclear orphan receptor
      RORgammat functions to coordinate the diverse cytokine-induced signals and thus
      controls Th17 cell differentiation.
