TI  - Intestinal CD4(+)CD25(high) regulatory T cells are expanded in ankylosing
      spondylitis patients: A putative role for IL-10 in preventing intestinal
      TH17 response.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: subclinical gut inflammation has been demonstrated in
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. Aim of this study was to determine
      the frequency of regulatory CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells (T(reg)), and to
      evaluate T(reg)-related cytokines (IL-2, TGF-beta, IL-10), and
      transcription factors (FOXP3 and STAT5) in the ileum of AS patients.
      METHODS:: Quantitative gene expression analysis, by rt-PCR, of
      T(reg)-related cytokines (IL-2, TGF-beta, IL-10) and transcription factor
      (STAT-5 and FOXP3) was performed on ileal biopsies of 18 AS and 15 active
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 15 healthy subjects (HS). Tissue and
      circulating T(reg) cells were also analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS:: A
      significant up-regulation of IL-2, TGF-beta, FOXP3, STAT-5 and IL-10
      transcripts in the terminal ileum of AS patients displaying chronic ileal
      inflammation was observed. Flow cytometric analysis of T(reg) cells showed
      significant peripheral expansion in both chronic inflamed AS and CD
      patients (1.08%+/-0.4% and 1.05+/-0.3% respectively), compared to HS
      (0.25+/-0.12; p<0.05). Interestingly a five-fold increase in the
      proportion of T(reg) cells was observed in the gut of AS patients (5+/-3%;
      p<0.001) compared to HS (1.2%+/-0.4%), with 70 to 80% of these cells also
      producing IL-10. In vitro studies showed that block of IL-10 was
      sufficient to induce Th17 polarization on isolated lamina propria
      mononuclear cells (LPMC) from AS patients. CONCLUSION:: Here we provide
      the first evidence that an active T(reg) cell response, mainly dominated
      by IL-10 production, occurs in the gut of AS patients, probably
      responsible for the absence of a clear TH17 polarization observed in the
      ileum of AS patients.

TI  - Increased CD127 expression on activated FOXP3+CD4+ regulatory T cells.
PG  - 2528-38
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Treg) are commonly identified by CD25 (IL-2R alpha)
      surface expression and/or intracellular expression of the FOXP3
      transcription factor. In addition, Treg are also characterized by low
      CD127 (IL-7R alpha) expression when compared to conventional T cells and
      their biology in the periphery is considered essentially independent of
      IL-7. We further investigated CD127 expression on Treg and we demonstrated
      differential CD127 expression depending on Treg subsets considered.
      Notably, we observed high CD127 expression on inducible costimulatory
      molecule (ICOS)- and CD103-expressing Treg subsets. Since these two
      markers reflect activation status, we addressed whether Treg activation
      modulated CD127 expression. We demonstrated that in contrast to
      conventional T cells, Treg significantly upregulated CD127 expression
      during in vitro and in vivo activation using adoptive transfer and contact
      dermatitis models. High CD127 expression on Treg was also predominantly
      detected ex vivo in some specific sites, notably bone marrow and skin.
      Importantly, higher CD127 expression on Treg correlated with higher
      phosphorylation of STAT5 upon IL-7 exposure. High CD127 expression on Treg
      also provided survival advantage upon in vitro incubation with IL-7. We
      thus demonstrated that low CD127 expression is not an intrinsic
      characteristic of Treg and we identified activated Treg as a potential
      target of endogenous or therapeutic IL-7.

      regulatory T cells and inhibits effector T cells.
PG  - 1785-95
AB  - The Jak inhibitor CP-690,550 inhibits alloreactivity and is currently
      being investigated for prevention of allograft rejection after
      transplantation. In this study, we examined the effect of CP-690,550 on
      IL-2-mediated Jak/STAT5 phosphorylation by
      CD4(+)CD25(bright)FoxP3(+)CD127(-/low) T cells (Treg) and CD4(+)CD25(neg)
      effector T cells (Teff) in kidney transplant (KTx) patients.
      Phosphospecific flow cytometry was used to study the effect of CP-690,550
      on IL-2-induced intracellular STAT5-phosphorylation. IL-2-induced
      phosphorylation of STAT5 (P-STAT5) in both Treg and Teff, which was
      significantly higher for CD4(+)CD25(bright) Treg (increased by 71%, mean)
      than for CD4(+)CD25(neg) Teff (increased by 42%). In the presence of 100
      ng/mL CP-690,550, a clinically relevant exposure, IL-2-induced P-STAT5 was
      partially inhibited in CD4(+)CD25(bright)Treg (% inhibition; 51%), while
      almost completely blocked in Teff (%inhibition; 84%, p = 0.03). The IC(50)
      was 2-3 times higher for Treg (104 ng/mL) than for Teff (40 ng/mL, p =
      0.02). In the presence of CP-690,550, Treg exhibited additional
      suppressive activities on the alloactivated proliferation of Teff (56%,
      mean). In addition, CD4(+)CD25(bright) Treg from KTx-patients receiving
      CP-690,550 vigorously suppressed the proliferation of Teff (87%, mean).
      Our findings show that CP-690,550 effectively inhibits Teff function but
      preserves the suppressive activity of CD4(+)CD25(bright) regulatory T
      cells.

TI  - A physiological role for inducible FOXP3(+) Treg cells. Lessons from women
      with reproductive failure.
PG  - 432-41
AB  - We have previously shown a decreased frequency and function of Tregs in
      women suffering from recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA). In the current
      study, we first investigated the expression of FOXP3 after T-cell
      activation. We observed that expression of FOXP3 in activated PBMCs was
      already present above baseline before any cell division, indicating that
      it was induced in cells that were previously negative for this
      transcription factor. Because RSA women showed a more limited expansion of
      FOXP3-positive cells, we next assessed the role of IL-2 signaling through
      STAT5, which is known to be required for generation of inducible Tregs
      (iTregs). We demonstrated not only that TGF-beta and IL-2 were diminished
      but also that the IL-2-STAT-5 signaling axis was down regulated in RSA
      women. Finally, in addition to a limited FOXP3(+) cells expansion in
      vitro, iTregs from RSA women showed a strikingly lower suppressor
      activity.

TI  - High content cellular immune profiling reveals differences between rhesus
      monkeys and men.
PG  - 128-40
AB  - A better understanding of similarities and differences in the composition
      of the cellular immune system in non-human primates (NHPs) compared with
      human subjects will improve the interpretation of preclinical studies. It
      will also aid in addressing the usefulness of NHPs as subjects for
      studying chronic diseases, vaccine development and immune reconstitution.
      We employed high content colour flow cytometry and analysed simultaneously
      the expression of CD3, CD4, CD8alpha, CD8beta, CD16/CD56, CD45RA, CCR7,
      CD27, CD28, CD107a and the interleukin-7 receptor alpha-chain (IL-7Ralpha)
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 27 rhesus macaques and 16
      healthy human subjects. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were identified using
      anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD25, -FoxP3, and -IL-7Ralpha monoclonal antibodies.
      Responsiveness to IL-7 was gauged in a signal transducer and activation of
      transcription 5 (STAT-5) phosphorylation assay. Human and NHP PBMCs showed
      a similar T-cell composition pattern with some remarkable differences.
      Similarities: human and NHP CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells showed a similar
      STAT-5 phosphorylation pattern in response to IL-7. Multicolour flow
      cytometric analysis identified a CD4(+) CD8alphaalpha(+) CD8alphabeta(+)
      T-cell population in NHPs as well as in human subjects that expressed the
      degranulation marker CD107a and may represent a unique CD4(+) T-cell
      subset endowed with cytotoxic capacity. Differences: we identified in
      PBMCs from NHPs a higher proportion (5.16% in CD3(+) T cells) of
      CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells when compared with human donors (1.22% in CD3(+)
      T cells). NHP CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells produced tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha / interferon-gamma (TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma) or TNF-alpha,
      whereas human CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells produced simultaneously
      TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma and IL-2. A minor percentage of human CD8(+) T cells
      expressed CD25(bright) and FoxP3 (0.01%). In contrast, 0.07% of NHP CD8(+)
      T cells exhibited the CD25(bright) FoxP3(+) phenotype. PBMCs from NHPs
      showed less IL-7Ralpha-positive events in all T-cell subsets including
      CD4(+) Tregs (median 5%) as compared with human (median 12%). The data
      visualize commonalities and differences in immune cell subsets in humans
      and NHPs, most of them in long-lived memory cells and cells with
      suppressive functions. This provides a matrix to assess future efforts to
      study diseases and vaccines in NHPs.

TI  - Expression of the autoimmune susceptibility gene FcRL3 on human regulatory
      T cells is associated with dysfunction and high levels of programmed cell
      death-1.
PG  - 3639-47
AB  - CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (T(reg)) play a critical role in
      maintaining self-tolerance and inhibiting autoimmune disease. Despite
      being a major focus of modern immunological investigation, many aspects of
      T(reg) biology remain unknown. In a screen for novel candidate genes
      involved in human T(reg) function, we detected the expression of an
      autoimmune susceptibility gene, FcRL3, in T(reg) but not in conventional
      CD4(+) T cells. FcRL3 is an orphan receptor of unknown function with
      structural homology to classical Fc receptors. Numerous genetic studies
      have demonstrated a link between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the
      FCRL3 promoter and both overexpression of FcRL3 and autoimmune diseases
      such as rheumatoid arthritis. Given the critical role of T(reg) in
      suppressing autoimmunity, we sought to ascertain how expression of FcRL3
      relates to the phenotype, differentiation, and function of T(reg). We show
      in this study that FcRL3 is expressed on a population of thymically
      derived T(reg) that exhibits a memory phenotype and high levels of
      programmed cell death-1. Purified FcRL3(+) T(reg) are less responsive to
      antigenic stimulation in the presence of IL-2 than their FcRL3(-)
      counterparts, despite intact proximal and distal IL-2 signaling as
      determined by phosphorylation of Stat-5 and upregulation of Bcl2. In vitro
      suppression assays demonstrated that FcRL3(+) T(reg) have reduced capacity
      to suppress the proliferation of effector T cells. These data suggest that
      FcRL3 expression is associated with T(reg) dysfunction that may, in turn,
      contribute to the loss of self-tolerance and the development of
      autoimmunity.

PG  - 96-108
AB  - Interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a central role in controlling the homeostasis
      of both naive and long-term-memory CD4(+) T cells. To better understand
      how human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) perturbs CD4(+) T-cell homeostasis,
      we performed a detailed analysis of IL-7R expression, IL-7 binding, and
      IL-7-dependent early and late signaling events in CD4(+) T-cell subsets
      from viremic and efficiently treated patients. HIV infection
      differentially affected the expression of IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) chains,
      with decreases in IL-7Ralpha/CD127 expression in the memory subset and
      increases in gammac/CD132 expression in all CD4(+) T cells. This resulted
      in preserved IL-7 binding in the naive compartment and decreased IL-7
      binding in the memory compartment of viremic patients. Accordingly, the
      percentages of cells signaling in response to IL-7, as measured by pSTAT5
      induction, were decreased in memory subsets, including conventional CD4(+)
      T cells and regulatory T cells. However, the levels of pSTAT5 induction
      per responding cell, as measured by pSTAT5 fluorescence intensity, were
      increased within all naive and memory CD4(+) T-cell subsets of viremic
      patients. The basal level of pSTAT5 was also increased, indicating a
      constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT5 pathway. IL-7 functional
      responses, as measured by Bcl-2, CD25, and Foxp3 induction, were impaired
      in viremic patient CD4(+) T cells, suggesting that chronic activation led
      to downstream defects in the STAT5 signaling pathway. Thus, HIV infection
      perturbs IL-7 responses at both receptor binding and signaling steps,
      which likely compromises the regenerative capacity of the CD4(+) T-cell
      pool and may contribute to CD4(+) T-cell depletion.

TI  - Protein kinase B/Akt signals impair Th17 differentiation and support
      natural regulatory T cell function and induced regulatory T cell
      formation.
PG  - 6124-34
AB  - Protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt signals control T cell proliferation and
      differentiation but their effect on the generation and function of
      regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th17 cells is not well understood. In this
      study, we show that elevated PKB signals antagonize the immunosuppressive
      effect of TGF-beta1 on cell size, CD25 and CD98 expression, and
      proliferation of CD3-stimulated naive CD4(+) T cells from wild-type and
      CD28-deficient mice. Conventional CD4(+) T cells expressing active PKB are
      less susceptible to suppression by natural regulatory T cells. Although
      PKB signals do not affect the development of natural regulatory T cells,
      they enhance their suppressor capacity. Upon TCR triggering and TGF-beta1
      costimulation, wild-type and CD28-deficient CD4(+) T cells transgenic for
      PKB readily express Foxp3, thereby acquiring suppressor capacity. These
      effects of elevated PKB signals on T cell function involve a marked and
      sustained activation of STAT5 and Foxp3 and reduction in nuclear NFATc1
      levels. In contrast, PKB signals impair TGF-beta1/IL-6-mediated
      differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into the Th17 lineage. This
      correlates with an increased signaling of ERK, STAT5, and STAT6. Finally,
      elevated PKB signals reduced the severity of experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis in wild-type mice but induced experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis in mice deficient for CD28. Altogether, these data
      indicate an important role of PKB signals on control of TGF-beta1-mediated
      T cell responses and, thereby, on tolerizing and inflammatory immune
      processes.

TI  - Cell contact interaction between adipose-derived stromal cells and
      allo-activated T lymphocytes.
PG  - 3436-46
AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells regulate immune cell function via the secretion
      of soluble factors. Cell membrane interactions between these cell types
      may play an additional role. Here, we demonstrate that subpopulations of
      allo-activated T cells are capable of binding to human adipose-derived
      stromal cells (ASC). The bound T-cell population contained CD8+ T cells
      and was enriched for CD4-CD8- T cells, whereas the proportion of CD4+ T
      cells was decreased compared with the non-bound T-cell population. Bound
      CD4+ T cells had high proliferative activity and increased CD25 and FoxP3
      expression. However, they also expressed CD127, excluding regulatory
      T-cell function. In CD8+ T cells, IL-2 sensitivity, as determined by the
      analysis of phosphorylated STAT5, was lower in the presence of ASC and
      even lower in bound cells. In contrast, IL-2-induced phosphorylated STAT5
      levels were higher in bound CD4+ T cells than in non-bound CD4+ T cells.
      Additionally, pro-proliferative TGF-beta signalling via endoglin and
      SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation was detected in bound CD4+ T cells. Even after
      prolonged co-culture with ASC, the activated phenotype of bound CD4+ T
      cells persisted. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the binding
      of lymphocytes to ASC represents an immunomodulatory mechanism in which
      CD8+ T cells are inhibited in their responsiveness to pro-inflammatory
      stimuli and reactive CD4+ T cells are depleted from the immune response.

TI  - The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist FTY720 potently inhibits
      regulatory T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 3751-60
AB  - CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cell (Treg) entry into secondary lymphoid
      organs and local expansion is critical for their immunosuppressive
      function. Long-term application of the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor
      agonist FTY720 exerts pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects, whereas
      short-term FTY720 boosts antiviral immunity. In this study, we provide
      evidence that FTY720 potently inhibits Treg proliferation in vitro and in
      vivo without affecting their viability, phenotype, or in vitro
      immunosuppression. In contrast, adoptively transferred Treg exposed ex
      vivo to FTY720 lost their protective effects in murine models of acute
      glomerulonephritis and acute graft-vs-host disease. On a cellular level,
      FTY720 inhibits IL-2-induced STAT-5 phosphorylation, paralleled by a loss
      of FoxP3 expression during Treg expansion in vitro. Notably, loss of in
      vivo immunosuppression is not due to impaired migration to or localization
      within secondary lymphoid organs. We could even show a selective trapping
      of adoptively transferred Treg in inflammatory lymph nodes by FTY720.
      Finally, Treg isolated from animals systemically exposed to FTY720 also
      exhibit a significantly impaired proliferative response upon restimulation
      when compared with Treg isolated from solvent-treated animals. In summary,
      our data suggest that sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor-mediated signals
      induced by FTY720 abrogate their in vivo immunosuppressive potential by
      blocking IL-2 induced expansion, which is indispensable for their in vivo
      immunosuppressive activity.

TI  - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 limits the development
      of adaptive regulatory T cells.
PG  - 587-95
AB  - T-cell responses to a cytokine milieu instruct the development of multiple
      effector phenotypes. While transforming growth factor-beta(1)
      (TGF-beta(1)) inhibits the development of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2
      cells, we demonstrate that like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-4, IL-12 can
      inhibit the development of TGF-beta(1)-induced Foxp3-expressing adaptive T
      regulatory (aTreg) cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription
      4 (STAT4) is critical for the response to IL-12, although there is a
      parallel pathway involving T box expressed in T cells (T-bet), and cells
      from mice double-deficient in STAT4 and T-bet are refractory to the
      inhibition of aTreg-cell development by IL-12. While the ability of these
      cytokines to promote Th differentiation may contribute to this effect, we
      observe that culture with IL-12, or other instructive cytokines, results
      in an increase in repressive chromatin modifications at the Foxp3 locus
      that limit STAT5 binding to Foxp3, without observed effects on IL-2
      signalling pathways. In a model of allergic lung inflammation there are
      increased percentages of Treg cells in the lungs of Stat4(-/-) mice,
      compared with wild-type mice, and increases in Treg cells correlate with
      decreased allergic inflammation. Overall, these results suggest an
      important role for STAT4 in regulating Treg-cell development.

TI  - Differential responses of human regulatory T cells (Treg) and effector T
      cells to rapamycin.
PG  - e5994
AB  - BACKGROUND: The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (RAPA) promotes the
      expansion of CD4(+) CD25(high)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells via mechanisms
      that remain unknown. Here, we studied expansion, IL-2R-gamma chain
      signaling, survival pathways and resistance to apoptosis in human Treg
      responding to RAPA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CD4(+)CD25(+) and
      CD4(+)CD25(neg) T cells were isolated from PBMC of normal controls (n =
      21) using AutoMACS. These T cell subsets were cultured in the presence of
      anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and 1000 IU/mL IL-2 for 3 to 6 weeks. RAPA (1-100
      nM) was added to half of the cultures. After harvest, the cell phenotype,
      signaling via the PI3K/mTOR and STAT pathways, expression of survival
      proteins and Annexin V binding were determined and compared to values
      obtained with freshly-separated CD4(+)CD25(high) and CD4(+)CD25(neg) T
      cells. Suppressor function was tested in co-cultures with autologous
      CFSE-labeled CD4(+)CD25(neg) or CD8(+)CD25(neg) T-cell responders. The
      frequency and suppressor activity of Treg were increased after culture of
      CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in the presence of 1-100 nM RAPA (p<0.001).
      RAPA-expanded Treg were largely CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) cells and were
      resistant to apoptosis, while CD4(+)CD25(neg) T cells were sensitive. Only
      Treg upregulated anti-apoptotic and down-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins.
      Treg expressed higher levels of the PTEN protein than CD4(+)CD25(neg)
      cells. Activated Treg+/-RAPA preferentially phosphorylated STAT5 and STAT3
      and did not utilize the PI3K/mTOR pathway. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: RAPA
      favors Treg expansion and survival by differentially regulating signaling,
      proliferation and sensitivity to apoptosis of human effector T cells and
      Treg after TCR/IL-2 activation.

TI  - The initial phase of an immune response functions to activate regulatory T
      cells.
PG  - 332-9
AB  - An early reaction of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to Ag is the production of
      cytokines, notably IL-2. To detect cytokine-dependent responses, naive
      Ag-specific T cells were stimulated in vivo and the presence of
      phosphorylated STAT5 molecules was used to identify the cell populations
      responding to IL-2. Within hours of T cell priming, IL-2-dependent STAT5
      phosphorylation occurred primarily in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. In
      contrast, the Ag-specific T cells received STAT5 signals only after
      repeated Ag exposure or memory differentiation. Regulatory T cells
      receiving IL-2 signals proliferated and developed enhanced suppressive
      activity. These results indicate that one of the earliest events in a T
      cell response is the activation of endogenous regulatory cells,
      potentially to prevent autoimmunity.

TI  - Impaired STAT phosphorylation in T cells from melanoma patients in
      response to IL-2: association with clinical stage.
PG  - 4085-94
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the extent of signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) activation in response to interleukin 2 (IL-2) in
      melanoma patients' T cells, along with clinical stage of tumor
      progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: T lymphocytes from peripheral blood of
      healthy donors and of American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to IV
      melanoma patients, as well as from metastatic lymph nodes of patients,
      were evaluated for responsiveness to IL-2. CFSE assays and single-cell
      phospho-STAT-specific flow cytometry screening were used. Results. T cells
      from advanced melanoma patients, in comparison with healthy donors, showed
      reduced proliferation to IL-2 and IL-15, but not to anti-CD3 monoclonal
      antibody. Impaired response occurred in CCR7(+) and CCR7(-) T-cell
      subsets, but not in CD3(-) CD8(+) natural killer (NK) cells, and was not
      explained by induction of apoptosis, increased cytokine consumption, or
      altered IL-2R subunit expression in patients' T lymphocytes. By
      phospho-specific flow cytometry, defective STAT1 and STAT5 activation in
      response to IL-2 was found mainly in T lymphocytes from peripheral blood
      and/or tumor site of American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III and IV
      patients, compared with stage I and II patients and to donors, and in
      melanoma antigen-specific T cells isolated from metastatic lymph nodes. At
      tumor site, impaired STAT activation in T cells did not correlate with
      frequency of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells. Serum from advanced melanoma
      patients inhibited IL-2-dependent STAT activation in donors' T cells and a
      neutralizing monoclonal antibody to transforming growth factor beta1
      counteracted such inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence
      for development of impaired STAT signaling in response to IL-2, along with
      clinical evolution of the disease, in melanoma patients' T cells.

TI  - CARMA1 controls an early checkpoint in the thymic development of FoxP3+
      regulatory T cells.
PG  - 6736-43
AB  - Natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) that develop in the thymus are
      essential to limit immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. However, the
      steps necessary for their thymic development are incompletely understood.
      The CARMA1/Bcl10/Malt1 (CBM) complex, comprised of adaptors that link the
      TCR to the transcription factor NF-kappaB, is required for development of
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) but not conventional T cells. Current models
      propose that TCR-NF-kappaB is needed in a Treg-extrinsic manner for IL-2
      production by conventional T cells or in already precommitted Treg
      precursors for driving IL-2/STAT5 responsiveness and further maturation
      into Tregs and/or for promoting cell survival. Using CARMA1-knockout mice,
      our data show instead that the CBM complex is needed in a Treg-intrinsic
      rather than -extrinsic manner. Constitutive activity of STAT5 or
      protection from apoptosis by transgenic expression of Bcl2 in developing
      Tregs is not sufficient to rescue CARMA1-knockout Treg development.
      Instead, our results demonstrate that the CBM complex controls an early
      checkpoint in Treg development by enabling generation of thymic precursors
      of Tregs. These data suggest a modified model of nTreg development in
      which TCR-CBM-dependent signals are essential to commit immature
      thymocytes to the nTreg lineage.

TI  - IL-9 induces differentiation of TH17 cells and enhances function of FoxP3+
      natural regulatory T cells.
PG  - 12885-90
AB  - The development of T helper (T(H))17 and regulatory T (T(reg)) cells is
      reciprocally regulated by cytokines. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
      alone induces FoxP3(+) T(reg) cells, but together with IL-6 or IL-21
      induces T(H)17 cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-9 is a key molecule that
      affects differentiation of T(H)17 cells and T(reg) function. IL-9
      predominantly produced by T(H)17 cells, synergizes with TGF-beta1 to
      differentiate naive CD4(+) T cells into T(H)17 cells, while IL-9 secretion
      by T(H)17 cells is regulated by IL-23. Interestingly, IL-9 enhances the
      suppressive functions of FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T(reg) cells in vitro, and
      absence of IL-9 signaling weakens the suppressive activity of nT(regs) in
      vivo, leading to an increase in effector cells and worsening of
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The mechanism of IL-9 effects
      on T(H)17 and T(regs) is through activation of STAT3 and STAT5 signaling.
      Our findings highlight a role of IL-9 as a regulator of pathogenic versus
      protective mechanisms of immune responses.

TI  - Regulatory T cells and extracorporeal photochemotherapy: correlation with
      clinical response and decreased frequency of proinflammatory T cells.
PG  - 1422-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune mechanisms of extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) in
      refractory/resistant graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) are complex. We have
      previously analyzed the role of CD4CD25Foxp3 regulatory T cells (T-regs).
      METHODS: In the current study, we have enlarged the size of the population
      (n=27; chronic GvHD=18, acute GvHD=9) for a median follow-up of 24 months.
      T-regs were monitored for CD4, CD25, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis
      factor receptor (GITR), CD62L, CCR7, Foxp3, and STAT-5. Immune analysis by
      interleukin (IL)-17 Elispot was carried out on circulating T-helper CD4
      cells secreting IL-17, a subset of T cells considered relevant in the
      pathogenesis of GvHD. RESULTS: We confirm that ECP is accompanied by a
      significant increase of CD4CD25Foxp3GITRCD62LCCR7 T-regs. Sorted T-regs
      show augmented phosphorylation of STAT-5. Only ECP-responding patients
      demonstrate a raise of circulating T-regs, being mostly affected by
      chronic GvHD. Moreover, this phenomenon corresponds to a diminished
      secretion of IL-17. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our study shows that T-regs
      represent important immune mediators of the clinical benefits of ECP in
      patients affected by GvHD.

AB  - CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs suppress autoimmune responses. In addition, they
      limit T cell responses during chronic infection, thereby minimizing T
      cell-dependent immunopathology. We sought to investigate how Tregs are
      regulated in the livers of patients chronically infected with HCV, where
      they control the balance between an adequate protective immune response
      and suppression of immunopathology. We found that, despite accumulating
      and proliferating at sites of infection in the livers of patients
      chronically infected with HCV, Tregs were relatively less expanded than
      CD4+CD25+Foxp3- effector T cells. The relative lower expansion of
      intrahepatic Tregs coincided with their upregulation of programmed death-1
      (PD-1). PD-1 expression inversely correlated with both Treg proliferation
      and clinical markers of immune suppression in vivo. Consistent with the
      possibility that PD-1 controls Tregs, blockade of the interaction between
      PD-1 and programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) enhanced the in vitro
      expansion and function of Tregs isolated from the livers of patients
      chronically infected with HCV. Blockade of the interaction between PD-L1
      and B7.1 also improved the proliferation of these cells. Interestingly,
      both PD-1 and phosphorylated STAT-5 were overexpressed in intrahepatic
      Tregs in a parallel fashion in steady disease conditions, and in an
      alternate-fluctuating fashion during the course of severe hepatitis
      reactivation. Notably, PD-L1 blockade upregulated STAT-5 phosphorylation
      in Tregs ex vivo. These data suggest that PD-L1 negatively regulates Tregs
      at sites of chronic inflammation by controlling STAT-5 phosphorylation.

TI  - A low interleukin-2 receptor signaling threshold supports the development
      and homeostasis of T regulatory cells.
PG  - 204-17
AB  - Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling is essential for T regulatory
      (Treg) cell development and homeostasis. Here, we show that expression of
      IL-2Rbeta chains that lack tyrosine residues important for the association
      of the adaptor Shc and the transcription factor STAT5 in
      IL-2Rbeta-deficient mice resulted in production of a normal proportion of
      natural Treg cells that suppressed severe autoimmunity related with
      deficiency in IL-2 or IL-2R. These mutant IL-2Rbeta chains supported
      suboptimal and transient STAT5 activation that upregulate the
      transcription factor Foxp3 to normal amounts in natural, but not induced,
      Treg cells. Nevertheless, gene expression profiling revealed many targets
      in peripheral natural Treg cells that were IL-2 dependent and a
      substantial overlap between the Treg cell IL-2-dependent gene program and
      the Treg cell transcriptional signature. Collectively, these findings
      demonstrate that a critical, and perhaps minor, subset of IL-2-dependent
      targets is indexed to a low IL-2R signaling threshold and that a
      substantial proportion of the Treg cell gene program is regulated by IL-2.

TI  - Foxp3-dependent microRNA155 confers competitive fitness to regulatory T
      cells by targeting SOCS1 protein.
PG  - 80-91
AB  - Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells limit pathogenic immune responses to
      self-antigens and foreign antigens. An essential role for microRNA (miRNA)
      in the maintenance and function of Treg cells, revealed by the Treg
      cell-specific Dicer ablation, raised a question as to a specific miRNA
      contribution. We found that Foxp3 controlled the elevated miR155
      expression required for maintaining Treg cell proliferative activity and
      numbers under nonlymphopenic conditions. Moreover, miR155 deficiency in
      Treg cells resulted in increased suppressor of cytokine signaling 1
      (SOCS1) expression accompanied by impaired activation of signal transducer
      and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) transcription factor in response
      to limiting amounts of interleukin-2. Our studies suggest that
      Foxp3-dependent regulation of miR155 maintains competitive fitness of Treg
      cell subsets by targeting SOCS1, and they provide experimental support for
      a proposed role for miRNAs in ensuring the robustness of cellular
      phenotypes.

TI  - Effects of high-dose IFNalpha2b on regional lymph node metastases of human
      melanoma: modulation of STAT5, FOXP3, and IL-17.
PG  - 8314-20
AB  - PURPOSE: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and
      STAT3 oppose one another in regulation of the reciprocal development of
      CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17). A
      reduction in STAT3 is associated with up-regulation of Treg, and STAT5
      activation promotes Treg differentiation or function while constraining
      Th17 generation. The effects of IFNalpha on STAT signaling in relation to
      tumor tissue Treg and Th17 have not been documented in humans beyond the
      observations that IFNalpha2b down-regulates STAT3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
      Following diagnostic biopsy and before definitive surgery, 20 doses of
      high-dose IFNalpha2b (HDI) were administered to patients with stage IIIB
      melanoma who gave written informed consent. Lymph node biopsies, in which
      both total STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 were down-regulated by HDI, were
      probed with STAT5, FOXP3, CD4, and interleukin 17 (IL-17) with
      immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence techniques. RESULTS: The
      percentage of FOXP3+ lymphocytes determined by immunohistochemistry was
      up-regulated from 3.06 +/- 0.65% to 9.86 +/- 1.27% (n = 13, P = 0.0002),
      and this observation was confirmed by immunofluorescence evaluation of
      CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs. HDI induced STAT5 up-regulation (five cases observed) in
      melanoma cells and lymphocytes but did not induce the generation of
      IL-17-expressing lymphocytes. Increased STAT5 expression was associated
      with increased FOXP3 expression among lymphocytes, and STAT5 was
      constitutively activated among both melanoma cells and lymphocytes.
      CONCLUSION: IFNalpha2b up-regulates STAT5 and down-regulates STAT3, in
      conjunction with up-regulation of Treg and inhibition of IL-17-expressing
      lymphocytes in melanoma tissues. These findings suggest that the effects
      of IFNalpha may be potentiated through interference with the response of
      Tregs and/or STAT5.

TI  - Imatinib mesylate inhibits CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cell activity and
      enhances active immunotherapy against BCR-ABL- tumors.
PG  - 6955-63
AB  - Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571), a selective inhibitor of a restricted
      number of tyrosine kinases, has been effectively used for the treatment of
      Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias and gastrointestinal stromal
      tumors. Imatinib may also directly influence immune cells. Suppressive as
      well as stimulating effects of this drug on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T
      lymphocytes or dendritic cells have been reported. In the current study,
      we have investigated the influence of imatinib mesylate on
      CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg), a critical population of
      lymphocytes that contributes to peripheral tolerance. Used at
      concentrations achieved clinically, imatinib impaired Treg
      immunosuppressive function and FoxP3 expression but not production of
      IL-10 and TGF-beta in vitro. Imatinib significantly reduced the activation
      of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 in Treg. Analysis of Treg
      TCR-induced signaling cascade indicated that imatinib inhibited
      phosphorylation of ZAP70 and LAT. Substantiating these observations,
      imatinib treatment of mice decreased Treg frequency and impaired their
      immunosuppressive function in vivo. Furthermore, imatinib mesylate
      significantly enhanced antitumor immune responses to dendritic cell-based
      immunization against an imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL negative lymphoma. The
      clinical applications of imatinib mesylate might thus be expanded with its
      use as a potent immunomodulatory agent targeting Treg in cancer
      immunotherapy.

TI  - The production of IL-10 by human regulatory T cells is enhanced by IL-2
      through a STAT5-responsive intronic enhancer in the IL-10 locus.
PG  - 3897-905
AB  - STAT5 molecules are key components of the IL-2 signaling pathway, the
      deficiency of which often results in autoimmune pathology due to a reduced
      number of CD4(+)CD25(+) naturally occurring regulatory T (Treg) cells. One
      of the consequences of the IL-2-STAT5 signaling axis is up-regulation of
      FOXP3, a master control gene for naturally occurring Treg cells. However,
      the roles of STAT5 in other Treg subsets have not yet been elucidated. We
      recently demonstrated that IL-2 enhanced IL-10 production through STAT5
      activation. This occurred in two types of human Treg cells: a novel type
      of umbilical cord blood-derived Treg cell, termed HOZOT, and Tr1-like Treg
      cells, IL-10-Treg. In this study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of
      IL-10 production in these Treg cells, focusing specifically on the roles
      of STAT5. By performing bioinformatic analysis on the IL-10 locus, we
      identified one STAT-responsive element within intron 4, designated
      I-SRE-4, as an interspecies-conserved sequence. We found that I-SRE-4
      acted as an enhancer element, and clustered CpGs around the I-SRE-4 were
      hypomethylated in IL-10-producing Treg cells, but not in other T cells. A
      gel-shift analysis using a nuclear extract from IL-2-stimulated HOZOT
      confirmed that CpG DNA methylation around I-SRE-4 reduced STAT5 binding to
      the element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the in situ
      binding of IL-2-activated STAT5 to I-SRE-4. Thus, we provide molecular
      evidence for the involvement of an IL-2-STAT5 signaling axis in the
      expression of IL-10 by human Treg cells, an axis that is regulated by the
      intronic enhancer, I-SRE-4, and epigenetic modification of this element.

TI  - IL-2, -7, and -15, but not thymic stromal lymphopoeitin, redundantly
      govern CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell development.
PG  - 3285-90
AB  - Common gamma chain (gammac)-receptor dependent cytokines are required for
      regulatory T cell (Treg) development as gammac(-/-) mice lack Tregs.
      However, it is unclear which gammac-dependent cytokines are involved in
      this process. Furthermore, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has also
      been suggested to play a role in Treg development. In this study, we
      demonstrate that developing CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the thymus express the
      IL-2Rbeta, IL-4Ralpha, IL-7Ralpha, IL-15Ralpha, and IL-21Ralpha chains,
      but not the IL9Ralpha or TSLPRalpha chains. Moreover, only IL-2, and to a
      much lesser degree IL-7 and IL-15, were capable of transducing signals in
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs as determined by monitoring STAT5 phosphorylation.
      Likewise, IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, but not TSLP, were capable of inducing
      the conversion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(-) thymic Treg progenitors into
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) mature Tregs in vitro. To examine this issue in more
      detail, we generated IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-7Ralpha(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x
      IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice. We found that IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-7Ralpha(-/-) mice
      were devoid of Tregs thereby recapitulating the phenotype observed in
      gammac(-/-) mice; in contrast, the phenotype observed in IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x
      IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice was comparable to that seen in IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice.
      Finally, we observed that Tregs from both IL-2(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-)
      mice show elevated expression of IL-7Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha chains.
      Addition of IL-2 to Tregs from IL-2(-/-) mice led to rapid down-regulation
      of these receptors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IL-2
      plays the predominant role in Treg development, but that in its absence
      the IL-7Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha chains are up-regulated and allow for IL-7
      and IL-15 to partially compensate for loss of IL-2.

TI  - Gamma c-signaling cytokines induce a regulatory T cell phenotype in
      malignant CD4+ T lymphocytes.
PG  - 2506-12
AB  - In this study, we demonstrate that malignant mature CD4(+) T lymphocytes
      derived from cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) variably display some
      aspects of the T regulatory phenotype. Whereas seven cell lines
      representing a spectrum of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoproliferative
      disorders expressed CD25 and TGF-beta, the expression of FOXP3 and, to a
      lesser degree, IL-10 was restricted to two CTCL cell lines that are
      dependent on exogenous IL-2. IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21, all of which signals
      through receptors containing the common gamma chain, induced expression of
      IL-10 in the IL-2-dependent cell lines as well as primary leukemic CTCL
      cells. However, only IL-2 and IL-15, but not IL-21, induced expression of
      FOXP3. The IL-2-triggered induction of IL-10 and FOXP3 expression occurred
      by signaling through STAT3 and STAT5, respectively. Immunohistochemical
      analysis of the CTCL tissues revealed that FOXP3-expressing cells were
      common among the CD7-negative enlarged atypical and small lymphocytes at
      the early skin patch and plaque stages. Their frequency was profoundly
      diminished at the tumor stage and in the CTCL lymph node lesions with or
      without large cell transformation. These results indicate that the T
      regulatory cell features are induced in CTCL T cells by common gamma chain
      signaling cytokines such as IL-2 and do not represent a fully
      predetermined, constitutive phenotype independent of the local
      environmental stimuli to which these malignant mature CD4(+) T cells
      become exposed.

TI  - The influence of IL-2 family cytokines on activation and function of
      naturally occurring regulatory T cells.
PG  - 973-80
AB  - IL-2 is essential for CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3+ (FoxP3+) naturally
      occurring regulatory T cell (Treg) homeostasis and activation. Binding of
      IL-2 to its receptor leads to phosphorylation of STAT5, and binding of
      phosphorylated STAT5 to the foxp3 promoter increases foxp3 transcription,
      resulting in elevated levels of FoxP3 protein in Tregs. Transcriptional
      regulation by the elevated levels of FoxP3 is thought to be essential for
      the strong suppressor function seen in activated Tregs. IL-2 belongs to a
      family cytokines, which all depend on the common gamma-receptor chain
      (gammac). Given the well-documented effects of IL-2 on Treg function, the
      effect of other IL-2 family cytokines (IL-7, -15, and -21) on Tregs was
      examined. We observed that IL-7 and IL-15 induce STAT5 phosphorylation and
      up-regulation of FoxP3 in Tregs. STAT5 activation correlated with enhanced
      viability. However, only in the presence of IL-2 did Tregs acquire potent
      suppressor function. This finding is surprising, as IL-15 as well as IL-2
      use the same IL-2R betac and gammac for signaling. In contrast, IL-21
      activated STAT3 but did not activate STAT5 and had no effect on Treg
      viability, activation, or function. We therefore conclude that
      phosphorylation of STAT5, mediated through the IL-2Rgamma, promotes Treg
      survival in a resting and activated state. However, activation of STAT5
      alone in conjunction with TCR signaling is not sufficient for the
      induction of potent suppressor function in Tregs, as IL-7 and IL-15 are
      not capable of inducing potent Treg suppressor function.

TI  - Inhibition of midkine alleviates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
      through the expansion of regulatory T cell population.
PG  - 3915-20
AB  - CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells are crucial mediators of
      autoimmune tolerance. The factors that regulate Treg cells, however, are
      largely unknown. Here, we show that deficiency in midkine (MK), a
      heparin-binding growth factor involved in oncogenesis, inflammation, and
      tissue repair, attenuated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
      because of an expansion of the Treg cell population in peripheral lymph
      nodes and decreased numbers of autoreactive T-helper type 1 (T(H)1) and
      T(H)17 cells. MK decreased the Treg cell population ex vivo in a
      dose-dependent manner by suppression of STAT5 phosphorylation that is
      essential for Foxp3 expression. Moreover, administration of anti-MK RNA
      aptamers significantly expanded the Treg cell population and alleviated
      EAE symptoms. These observations indicate that MK serves as a critical
      suppressor of Treg cell expansion, and inhibition of MK using RNA aptamers
      may provide an effective therapeutic strategy against autoimmune diseases,
      including multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Naturally occurred CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells derived from thymus.
      It plays an important role in self-tolerance and allograft-tolerance
      through cell-contact dependent mechanism. This review described the
      advances of study on the probable regulatory factors of the naturally
      occurring regulatory T cells, such as Foxp3, IL-2, TGF-beta(1), dendritic
      cells and CTLA-4. As a marker of Treg, the expression of Foxp3 could be
      used to identify regulatory T cells. The combination of interferon 2 and
      IL-2Ralpha would activate Treg and promote its proliferation through the
      phosphorylation of STAT5. TGF-beta(1) on the cell surface may influence
      the function of Treg, while the secretion type of TGF-beta may promote the
      proliferation of Treg. Dendritic cells can positively or negatively
      regulate Treg, which depends on the signal transduction pathway. CTLA-4
      expressed on the surface of Treg might bind to the B7 molecule on the DC,
      effective cell or Treg itself directly or indirectly regulate Treg.

TI  - STAT5-signaling cytokines regulate the expression of FOXP3 in CD4+CD25+
      regulatory T cells and CD4+CD25- effector T cells.
PG  - 421-31
AB  - Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is considered a specific marker for CD4(+)CD25(+)
      regulatory T (Treg) cells, but increasing evidence suggests that human
      CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T (Teff) cells can transiently express FOXP3 upon
      activation. We demonstrate that the signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 5 (STAT5)-signaling cytokines, IL-2, IL-15 and to a lesser
      extent IL-7, induce FOXP3 up-regulation in vitro in activated human Teff
      cells. In contrast, cytokines which do not activate STAT5, such as IL-4 or
      transforming growth factor-beta alone, do not directly induce FOXP3
      expression in activated Teff cells. Moreover, expression of a
      constitutively active form of STAT5a is sufficient to induce FOXP3
      expression in Teff cells. Expression of FOXP3 in activated Teff cells
      requires both TCR-mediated activation and endogenous IL-2, but is not
      dependent on cell division and does not induce suppressive function. The
      presence of STAT5-activating cytokines is also required to maintain high
      FOXP3 expression and suppressive activity of Treg cells in vitro. These
      data indicate that activation of STAT5 sustains FOXP3 expression in both
      Treg and Teff cells and contribute to our understanding of how cytokines
      affect the expression of FOXP3.

TI  - IL-2 activation of STAT5 enhances production of IL-10 from human cytotoxic
      regulatory T cells, HOZOT.
PG  - 181-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL)-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine produced
      by many cell types, including T cells. We previously reported that a novel
      type of regulatory T (Treg) cells, termed HOZOT, which possesses a
      FOXP3+CD4+CD8+CD25+ phenotype and dual suppressor/cytotoxic activities,
      produced high levels of IL-10. In this study, we examined the mechanisms
      of high IL-10 production by HOZOT, focusing on Janus activating kinase
      (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling
      pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prepared five different types of T
      cells, including HOZOT from human umbilical cord blood. Cytokine
      productions of IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were compared among these T cells after
      anti-CD3/CD28 antibody stimulation in the presence or absence of IL-2.
      Specific inhibitors for JAK/STAT, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and
      nuclear factor for activated T cell (NFAT) were used to analyze signal
      transduction mechanisms. RESULTS: IL-10 production by HOZOTs was greatly
      enhanced by the addition of IL-2. Little or no enhancement of IFN-gamma
      and TNF-alpha production was observed under the same conditions. The
      enhancing effect of IL-2 was specific for both HOZOT and IL-10-secreting
      Treg cells. T helper type 2 cells, whose IL-10 production mechanisms
      involve GATA-3, failed to show IL-2-mediated enhancement of IL-10. Similar
      enhancing effects of IL-15 and IFN-alpha suggested a major role of
      JAK/STAT activation pathway for high IL-10 production. Further inhibitor
      experiments demonstrated that STAT5 rather than STAT3 was critically
      involved in this mechanism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that IL-2
      selectively enhanced production of IL-10 in HOZOT primarily through
      activation of STAT5, which synergistically acts with NF-kappaB/NFAT
      activation, implying a novel regulatory mechanism of IL-10 production in
      Treg cells.

TI  - Differential impact of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition on
      CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells compared with conventional CD4+ T
      cells.
PG  - 453-62
AB  - Based on their ability to control T-cell homeostasis,
      Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are being considered for
      treatment of autoimmune disorders and acute graft-versus-host disease
      (aGVHD). When combining Tregs with the immunosuppressant rapamycin (RAPA),
      we observed reduced alloreactive conventional T-cell (Tconv) expansion and
      aGVHD lethality compared with each treatment alone. This synergistic in
      vivo protection was paralleled by intact expansion of polyclonal Tregs
      with conserved high FoxP3 expression. In contrast to Tconv, activation of
      Tregs with alloantigen and interleukin-2 preferentially led to signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation and
      not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) pathway activity. Expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog
      deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
      pathway, remained high in Tregs but not Tconv during stimulation.
      Conversely, targeted deletion of PTEN increased susceptibility of Tregs to
      mTOR inhibition by RAPA. Differential impact of RAPA as a result of
      reduced usage of the mTOR pathway in Tregs compared with conventional T
      cells explains the synergistic effect of RAPA and Tregs in aGVHD
      protection, which has important implications for clinical trials using
      Tregs.

TI  - Retinoic acid inhibits Th17 polarization and enhances FoxP3 expression
      through a Stat-3/Stat-5 independent signaling pathway.
PG  - 1013-20
AB  - CD4(+) helper T (Th) cells play a crucial role in the delicate balance
      between host defense and autoimmune disease. Two important populations of
      helper T cells are the proinflammatory, interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing
      (Th17) cells and the anti-inflammatory forkhead box P3-positive (FoxP3(+))
      T regulatory (Treg) cells. Here we show that all-trans retinoic acid
      (ATRA) and other agonists of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha)
      inhibit the formation of Th17 cells and promote FoxP3 expression.
      Conversely, inhibition of retinoic acid signaling constrains transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) induction of FoxP3. The effect of ATRA is
      mediated independently of IL-2, signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 5 (Stat5) and Stat3, representing a novel mechanism for the
      induction of FoxP3 in CD4 T cells. As previous studies have shown that
      vitamin A derivatives are protective in animal models of autoimmune
      disease, the current data suggest a previously unrecognized role for
      RARalpha in the regulation of CD4(+) T-cell differentiation and provide a
      mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of retinoic acid.

TI  - Interaction of TNF with TNF receptor type 2 promotes expansion and
      function of mouse CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells.
PG  - 154-61
AB  - Although TNF is a major proinflammatory cytokine, increasing evidence
      indicates that TNF also has immunosuppressive feedback effects. We have
      demonstrated in this study that, in both resting and activated states,
      mouse peripheral CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) expressed
      remarkably higher surface levels of TNFR2 than CD4(+)CD25(-) T effector
      cells (Teffs). In cocultures of Tregs and Teffs, inhibition of
      proliferation of Teffs by Tregs was initially transiently abrogated by
      exposure to TNF, but longer exposure to TNF restored suppressive effects.
      Cytokine production by Teffs remained continually suppressed by Tregs. The
      profound anergy of Tregs in response to TCR stimulation was overcome by
      TNF, which expanded the Treg population. Furthermore, in synergy with
      IL-2, TNF expanded Tregs even more markedly up-regulated expression of
      CD25 and FoxP3 and phosphorylation of STAT5, and enhanced the suppressive
      activity of Tregs. Unlike TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 did not up-regulate
      FoxP3-expressing Tregs. Furthermore, the number of Tregs increased in
      wild-type mice, but not in TNFR2(-/-) mice following sublethal cecal
      ligation and puncture. Depletion of Tregs significantly decreased
      mortality following cecal ligation and puncture. Thus, the stimulatory
      effect of TNF on Tregs resembles the reported costimulatory effects of TNF
      on Teffs, but is even more pronounced because of the higher expression of
      TNFR2 by Tregs. Moreover, our study suggests that the slower response of
      Tregs than Teffs to TNF results in delayed immunosuppressive feedback
      effects.

TI  - Nonredundant roles for Stat5a/b in directly regulating Foxp3.
PG  - 4368-75
AB  - Stats (signal transducers and activators of transcription) regulate
      multiple aspects of T-cell fate. T regulatory (Treg) cells are a critical
      subset that limits immune responses, but the relative importance of
      Stat5a/b versus Stat3 for Treg cell development has been contentious. We
      observed that peripheral CD25(+)CD4(+) T cells were reduced in
      Stat5(DeltaN) mice; however, the levels of Foxp3, a transcription factor
      that is critical for Treg cells, were normal in splenic CD4(+) T cells
      even though they were reduced in the thymus. In contrast, complete
      deletion of Stat5a/b (Stat5(-/-)) resulted in dramatic reduction in CD25-
      or Foxp3-expressing CD4(+) T cells. An intrinsic requirement was
      demonstrated by reduction of Stat5a/b in CD4-expressing cells and by stem
      cell transplantation using Stat5(-/-) fetal liver cells. Stat5a/b were
      also required for optimal induction of Foxp3 in vitro and bound directly
      to the Foxp3 gene. Reduction of Stat3 in T cells did not reduce the
      numbers of Treg cells in the thymus or spleen; however, Stat3 was required
      for IL-6-dependent down-regulation of Foxp3. Therefore, we conclude that
      Stat5a/b have an essential, nonredundant role in regulating Treg cells,
      and that Stat3 and Stat5a/b appear to have opposing roles in the
      regulation of Foxp3.

TI  - IL-2 receptor beta-dependent STAT5 activation is required for the
      development of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.
PG  - 280-90
AB  - IL-2(-/-) mice develop autoimmunity despite having relatively normal
      numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In contrast, we demonstrate that
      IL-2(-/-) x IL-15(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice have a significant decrease
      in Treg numbers. Ectopic expression of foxp3 in a subset of CD4(+) T cells
      rescued Treg development and prevented autoimmunity in IL-2Rbeta(-/-)
      mice, suggesting that IL-2Rbeta-dependent signals regulate foxp3
      expression in Tregs. Subsequent analysis of IL-2Rbeta-dependent signal
      transduction pathways established that the transcription factor STAT5 is
      necessary and sufficient for Treg development. Specifically, T
      cell-specific deletion of STAT5 prevented Treg development; conversely,
      reconstitution of IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice with bone marrow cells expressing an
      IL-2Rbeta mutant that exclusively activates STAT5 restored Treg
      development. Finally, STAT5 binds to the promoter of the foxp3 gene
      suggesting that IL-2Rbeta-dependent STAT5 activation promotes Treg
      differentiation by regulating expression of foxp3.

TI  - Upregulation of Foxp3 expression in mouse and human Treg is IL-2/STAT5
      dependent: implications for the NOD STAT5B mutation in diabetes
      pathogenesis.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Treg), characterized as CD4(+)/CD25(+hi) T cells, are
      critical for sustaining and promoting immune tolerance. Treg are highly
      dependent on IL-2 and IL-2 signaling to maintain their numbers and
      function and interruption of this pathway promotes autoimmunity. The
      transcription factor, Foxp3, is also required for Treg function as
      defective Foxp3 promotes autoimmunity in both mice and humans. We
      previously reported a point mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the NOD
      STAT5B gene that limits DNA binding when compared to wild-type STAT5 mice.
      Based on the presence of five STAT5B consensus sequences in the Foxp3
      promotor, we hypothesized a critical linkage between IL-2 signaling/STAT5B
      and Foxp3 expression in Treg. Our data show IL-2 activates long-form (LF)
      STAT5 and sustains Foxp3 expression in Treg. In contrast, CD4(+)/CD25(-) T
      cells do not active LF STAT5 and do not express Foxp3 under the same
      conditions. In addition, blocking LF STAT5 activation with a Jak inhibitor
      (AG-490) significantly reduced Foxp3 expression in Treg. Examination of
      human Treg using flow cytometry and intracellular staining for Foxp3
      expression likewise demonstrates that IL-2 maintains Foxp3 expression
      through LF STAT5 signaling. These studies reveal a critical link between
      IL-2 mediated JAK-STAT5 signaling and the maintenance of Foxp3 expression
      in Treg of mice and humans.

TI  - Cutting edge: Paracrine, but not autocrine, IL-2 signaling is sustained
      during early antiviral CD4 T cell response.
PG  - 4257-61
AB  - IL-2 is expressed predominantly by activated T cells, and regulates T cell
      function by activating, via its receptor, the latent transcription factor
      STAT5. This signaling can occur in either a paracrine (between cells) or
      an autocrine (same cell) manner, although the kinetics by which these two
      signaling modes operate during in vivo T cell responses are unknown. In
      the current study, IL-2 expression and signaling in a clonotypic
      population of antiviral CD4+ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry during
      the initial 24 h of priming. IL-2 expression and STAT5 activation peaked
      in parallel, but surprisingly, were almost completely mutually exclusive.
      Thus, only paracrine IL-2 signaling could be observed. As an additional
      indication of the efficiency of paracrine IL-2 signaling, polyclonal
      CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells displayed detectable STAT5 activation
      under steady-state conditions, which was strongly enhanced by neighboring
      IL-2-expressing antiviral CD4 cells.

TI  - IL-2 regulates FOXP3 expression in human CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells
      through a STAT-dependent mechanism and induces the expansion of these
      cells in vivo.
PG  - 1571-9
AB  - IL-2 plays a critical role in the maintenance of CD4+CD25+ FOXP3(+)
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo. We examined the effects of IL-2
      signaling in human Tregs. In vitro, IL-2 selectively up-regulated the
      expression of FOXP3 in purified CD4+CD25+ T cells but not in CD4+CD25-
      cells. This regulation involved the binding of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins to
      a highly conserved STAT-binding site located in the first intron of the
      FOXP3 gene. We also examined the effects of low-dose IL-2 treatment in 12
      patients with metastatic cancer and 9 patients with chronic myelogenous
      leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
      Overall, IL-2 treatment resulted in a 1.9 median fold increase in the
      frequency of CD4+CD25+ cells in peripheral blood as well as a 9.7 median
      fold increase in FOXP3 expression in CD3+ T cells. CD56+CD3- natural
      killer (NK) cells also expanded during IL-2 therapy but did not express
      FOXP3. In vitro treatment of NK cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored
      the IL-2 signaling pathway leading to FOXP3 expression, suggesting that
      this gene was constitutively repressed by DNA methylation in these cells.
      Our findings support the clinical evaluation of low-dose IL-2 to
      selectively modulate CD4+CD25+ Tregs and increase expression of FOXP3 in
      vivo.
