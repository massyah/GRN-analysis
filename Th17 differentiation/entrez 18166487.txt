AB  - The discovery of a new lineage of helper T cells that selectively produces
      interleukin (IL)-17 has provided exciting new insights into immunoregulation,
      host defense and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Additionally, the
      discovery of this T cell subset has offered a fresh look at how the complexity of
      selective regulation of cytokine gene expression might relate to lineage
      commitment, terminal differentiation and immunologic memory. Information
      continues to accumulate on factors that regulate Th17 differentiation at a rapid 
      pace and a few lessons have emerged. Like other lineages, Th17 cells
      preferentially express a transcription factor, retinoic acid-related orphan
      receptor (ROR)gammat, whose expression seems to be necessary for IL-17
      production. In addition, signals from the T-cell receptor are a critical aspect
      of controlling IL-17 production and the transcription factor nuclear factor of
      activated T cells (NFATs) appears to be another important regulator. IL-6, IL-21 
      and IL-23 are all cytokines that activate the transcription factor STAT3, which
      has been established to be necessary for multiple aspects of the biology of Th17 
      cells. Similarly, TGFbeta-1 is important for the differentiation of murine Th17
      cells and inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs), but how it exerts its effect on 
      IL-17 gene transcription is unknown and there are data indicating TGFbeta-1 is
      not required for human Th17 differentiation. The extent to which Th17 cells
      represent terminally differentiated cells or whether they retain plasticity and
      can develop into another lineage such as IFNgamma secreting Th1 cells is also
      unclear. Precisely how cytokines produced by this lineage are selectively
      expressed and selectively extinguished through epigenetic modifications is an
      area of great importance, but considerable uncertainty.
