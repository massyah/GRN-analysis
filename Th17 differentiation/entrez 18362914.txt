AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor
      best known for mediating the toxicity of dioxin. Environmental factors are
      believed to contribute to the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases, many
      of which are due to the activity of T(H)17 T cells, a new helper T-cell subset
      characterized by the production of the cytokine IL-17. Here we show that in the
      CD4+ T-cell lineage of mice AHR expression is restricted to the T(H)17 cell
      subset and its ligation results in the production of the T(H)17 cytokine
      interleukin (IL)-22. AHR is also expressed in human T(H)17 cells. Activation of
      AHR by a high-affinity ligand during T(H)17 cell development markedly increases
      the proportion of T(H)17 T cells and their production of cytokines. CD4+ T cells 
      from AHR-deficient mice can develop T(H)17 cell responses, but when confronted
      with AHR ligand fail to produce IL-22 and do not show enhanced T(H)17 cell
      development. AHR activation during induction of experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis causes accelerated onset and increased pathology in wild-type
      mice, but not AHR-deficient mice. AHR ligands may therefore represent co-factors 
      in the development of autoimmune diseases.
