TI  - Inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta signalling attenuates
      interleukin (IL)-18 plus IL-2-induced interstitial lung disease in mice.
PG  - 394-402
AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is an intractable disease induced by
      various factors in humans. However, there is no universally effective
      treatment for ILD. In this study, we investigated the role of transforming
      growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling in the pathogenesis of ILD by using
      model mice. Injection of interleukin (IL)-18 plus IL-2 in C57BL6 (B6) mice
      resulted in acute ILD by infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells and a
      significant increase of TGF-beta mRNA in the lung. To examine the
      pathogenetic role of TGF-beta in ILD mice, we used SB-431542
      (4-[4-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-5-(2-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-benzamide),
      which is a potent and selective inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor I
      (TbetaRI), also known as activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5). Treatment
      of B6-ILD mice with SB-431542 resulted in improvement of ILD, delay in
      mortality, reduction of the expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-6
      in the lungs. The same treatment also decreased significantly the
      percentage of natural killer (NK) cells in the lungs (P < 0.05) and mRNA
      expression levels of certain chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 and
      CXCL10 in B6-ILD. These findings were confirmed by IL-18 plus IL-2
      treatment of Smad3-deficient (Smad3(-/-)) mice (P < 0.05). Our results
      showed that inhibition of TGF-beta signalling reduced the percentage of NK
      cells and the expression of certain chemokines in the lungs, resulting in
      improvement of ILD. The findings suggest that TGF-beta signalling may play
      an important role in the pathogenesis of IL-18 plus IL-2-induced ILD in
      mice.

TI  - The role of NF-kappaB and Smad3 in TGF-beta-mediated Foxp3 expression.
PG  - 2571-83
AB  - The transcription factor Foxp3 is essential for the development of
      functional, natural Treg (nTreg), which plays a prominent role in
      self-tolerance. Suppressive Foxp3(+) Treg cells can be generated from
      naive T cells ex vivo, following TCR and TGF-beta1 stimulations. However,
      the molecular contributions from the different arms of these pathways
      leading to Foxp3 expression are not fully understood. TGF-beta1-activated
      Smad3 plays a major role in the expression of Foxp3, since
      TGF-beta1-induced-Treg generation from Smad3(-/-) mice is markedly reduced
      and abolished by inactivating Smad2. In the TCR pathway, deletion of
      Bcl10, which activates NF-kappaB, markedly reduces both IL-2 and Foxp3
      production. However, partial rescue of Foxp3 expression occurs on addition
      of exogenous IL-2. TGF-beta1 significantly attenuates NF-kappaB binding to
      the Foxp3 promoter, while inducing Foxp3 expression. Furthermore, deletion
      of p50, a NF-kappaB subunit, results in increased Foxp3 expression despite
      a decline in the IL-2 production. We posit several TCR-NF-kappaB pathways,
      some increasing (Bcl10-IL-2-Foxp3) while others decreasing (p50-Foxp3)
      Foxp3 expression, with the former predominating. A better understanding of
      Foxp3 regulation could be useful in dissecting the cause of Treg
      dysfunction in several autoimmune diseases and for generating more potent
      TGF-beta1-induced-Treg cells for therapeutic purposes.

TI  - The mTOR kinase differentially regulates effector and regulatory T cell
      lineage commitment.
PG  - 832-44
AB  - Effector T cell differentiation requires the simultaneous integration of
      multiple, and sometimes opposing, cytokine signals. We demonstrated mTOR's
      role in dictating the outcome of T cell fate. mTOR-deficient T cells
      displayed normal activation and IL-2 production upon initial stimulation.
      However, such cells failed to differentiate into T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, or
      Th17 effector cells. The inability to differentiate was associated with
      decreased STAT transcription factor activation and failure to upregulate
      lineage-specific transcription factors. Under normally activating
      conditions, T cells lacking mTOR differentiated into Foxp3(+) regulatory T
      cells. This was associated with hyperactive Smad3 activation in the
      absence of exogenous TGF-beta. Surprisingly, T cells selectively deficient
      in TORC1 do not divert to a regulatory T cell pathway, implicating both
      TORC1 and TORC2 in preventing the generation of regulatory T cells.
      Overall, our studies suggest that mTOR kinase signaling regulates
      decisions between effector and regulatory T cell lineage commitment.

TI  - TGF-beta utilizes SMAD3 to inhibit CD16-mediated IFN-gamma production and
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in human NK cells.
PG  - 3784-92
AB  - TGF-beta can be a potent suppressor of lymphocyte effector cell functions
      and can mediate these effects via distinct molecular pathways. The role of
      TGF-beta in regulating CD16-mediated NK cell IFN-gamma production and
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is unclear, as are the
      signaling pathways that may be utilized. Treatment of primary human NK
      cells with TGF-beta inhibited IFN-gamma production induced by CD16
      activation with or without IL-12 or IL-2, and it did so without affecting
      the phosphorylation/activation of MAP kinases ERK and p38, as well as
      STAT4. TGF-beta treatment induced SMAD3 phosphorylation, and ectopic
      overexpression of SMAD3 resulted in a significant decrease in IFN-gamma
      gene expression following CD16 activation with or without IL-12 or IL-2.
      Likewise, NK cells obtained from smad3(-/-) mice produced more IFN-gamma
      in response to CD16 activation plus IL-12 when compared with NK cells
      obtained from wild-type mice. Coactivation of human NK cells via CD16 and
      IL-12 induced expression of T-BET, the positive regulator of IFN-gamma,
      and T-BET was suppressed by TGF-beta and by SMAD3 overexpression. An
      extended treatment of primary NK cells with TGF-beta was required to
      inhibit ADCC, and it did so by inhibiting granzyme A and granzyme B
      expression. This effect was accentuated in cells overexpressing SMAD3.
      Collectively, our results indicate that TGF-beta inhibits CD16-mediated
      human NK cell IFN-gamma production and ADCC, and these effects are
      mediated via SMAD3.

TI  - Twisted gastrulation (Tsg) is regulated by Tob and enhances TGF-beta
      signaling in activated T lymphocytes.
PG  - 2944-52
AB  - Quiescent T cells express Tob, an APRO gene family member, which functions
      as a transcriptional regulator. Subtractive hybridization identified
      Twisted gastrulation (Tsg) as one of the genes suppressed by Tob. Tsg is a
      secreted protein that interacts with Drosophila decapentaplegic (Dpp) and
      its vertebrate orthologs BMP2/4 and regulates morphogenetic effects in
      embryos. Here, we report the expression and function of Tsg in human T
      cells. Tsg mRNA was almost undetectable in unstimulated T cells and was
      up-regulated after activation by TCR/CD3 and either CD28, IL-2, or PMA.
      Tsg protein had no effect on responses of primary T cells to TCR/CD3
      stimulation but had a potent inhibitory effect on proliferation and
      cytokine production of primed alloreactive CD4+ cells. Surprisingly, Tsg
      did not affect phosphorylation of the BMP-specific Smad1 but induced
      phosphorylation of the TGF-beta-specific Smad2 and mediated DNA binding on
      Smad3/4 consensus-binding sites, suggesting that it acted downstream of
      TGF-beta. In vitro association assays revealed a direct interaction of Tsg
      and TGF-beta proteins. Thus, Tsg functions as an agonist synergizing with
      TGF-beta to inhibit T-cell activation. Modulation of Tsg signaling may
      represent a novel target for molecular intervention toward control of
      aberrant T-cell responses during ongoing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
      and autoimmune diseases.

      which is activated by TGF-beta1, also plays a role in SP-A-mediated
      inhibition of CD4+ T lymphocyte activation. Recombinant human SP-A1
      expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells [rSP-A1m (mammalian)], but not
      recombinant Baculovirus-derived rSP-A1hyp (hydroxyproline-deficient),
      suppressed T lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 mRNA expression. To test
      whether SP-A induced Smad signaling, a Smad3/4-specific reporter gene was
      transfected in primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes. Only rSP-A1m, but not
      rSP-A1hyp, induced Smad-specific reporter genes, Smad2 phosphorylation,
      and Smad7 mRNA expression. The effect of rSP-A1m was mediated through the
      TGF-betaRII and could be antagonized by anti-TGF-beta1 neutralizing
      antibodies and sTGF-betaRII. Western blot and ELISA analysis revealed that
      rSP-A1m, but not rSP-A1hyp, contained TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 was responsible
      for the differences in inhibition of CD4+ T lymphocyte proliferation and
      activation of the Smad signaling pathway between rSP-A1m and rSP-A1hyp.
      After acidification, native SP-A, obtained from patients with alveolar
      proteinosis, also induced Smad signaling in human CD4+ T lymphocytes
      leading to an increased inhibition of T lymphocyte proliferation, thus
      indicating the presence of inactive, latent TGF-beta1 in native SP-A
      samples. Association between SP-A and latent TGF-beta1 provides a possible
      novel mechanism to regulate TGF-beta1-mediated inflammation and fibrosis
      reactions in the lung but also leads to possible misinterpretation of
      immune-modulator functions of SP-A. Monitoring of SP-A preparations for
      possible TGF-beta1 is essential.

TI  - Smad-dependent cooperative regulation of interleukin 2 receptor alpha
      chain gene expression by T cell receptor and transforming growth
      factor-beta.
PG  - 34042-7
AB  - The interleukin 2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2Ralpha) is a component of high
      affinity IL-2 receptors and thus critically regulates T cell growth and
      other lymphoid functions. Five positive regulatory regions together
      control lineage-restricted and activation-dependent IL-2Ralpha induction
      in response to antigen and IL-2. We now show that TGF-beta cooperates with
      T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to increase IL-2Ralpha gene expression.
      Moreover, we identify a sixth positive regulatory region that regulates
      IL-2Ralpha expression in cells treated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 as well
      as TGF-beta and show that this region contains binding sites for Smad3,
      AP-1, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/ATF proteins. The
      importance of Smad complexes is indicated by impaired IL-2Ralpha induction
      by TGF-beta in CD4+ T cells from both Smad3-/- and Smad4-/- mice. Thus, we
      have identified a novel positive regulatory region in the IL-2Ralpha gene
      that mediates TGF-beta-dependent induction of the gene. These findings
      have implications related to IL-2Ralpha expression on activated T cells
      and regulatory T cells.
