TI  - Coupling of tandem Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor (Smurf) WW
      domains modulates target specificity.
AB  - Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase
      that participates in degradation of TGF-beta receptors and other targets.
      Smurf2 WW domains recognize PPXY (PY) motifs on ubiquitin ligase target
      proteins or on adapters, such as Smad7, that bind to E3 target proteins.
      We previously demonstrated that the isolated WW3 domain of Smurf2, but not
      the WW2 domain, can directly bind to a Smad7 PY motif. We show here that
      the WW2 augments this interaction by binding to the WW3 and making
      auxiliary contacts with the PY motif and a novel E/D-S/T-P motif, which is
      N-terminal to all Smad PY motifs. The WW2 likely enhances the selectivity
      of Smurf2 for the Smad proteins. NMR titrations confirm that Smad1 and
      Smad2 are bound by Smurf2 with the same coupled WW domain arrangement used
      to bind Smad7. The analogous WW domains in the short isoform of Smurf1
      recognize the Smad7 PY peptide using the same coupled mechanism. However,
      a longer Smurf1 isoform, which has an additional 26 residues in the
      inter-WW domain linker, is only partially able to use the coupled WW
      domain binding mechanism. The longer linker results in a decrease in
      affinity for the Smad7 peptide. Interdomain coupling of WW domains
      enhances selectivity and enables the tuning of interactions by isoform
      switching.

TI  - Activin A Balances Sertoli and Germ Cell Proliferation in the Fetal Mouse
      Testis.
AB  - Activin affects many aspects of cellular development including those
      essential for reproductive fitness. This study examined the contribution
      of activin A to murine fetal testicular development, revealing contrasting
      outcomes of activin actions on Sertoli cells and gonocytes. Shortly after
      sex determination, from Embryonic Day (E)12.5 through to birth (0 dpp),
      the activin A subunit transcript (Inhba) level rises in testis, but not
      ovary, followed closely by the Inha transcript (encoding the inhibitory
      inhibin alpha subunit). Activin receptor transcript levels also change,
      with Acvr1 (encoding ALK2) and Acvr2b (ActRIIB) significantly higher and
      lower, respectively, at 0 dpp compared with E13.5 and E15.5. Transcripts
      encoding the signalling mediators Smad1, Smad3 and Smad4 were higher at 0
      dpp compared with E13.5 and E15.5, while Smad2, Smad5 and Smad7 were
      lower. Detection of phosphorylated (P-)SMAD2/3 in nearly all testis cell
      nuclei indicated widespread TGFB and/or activin ligand signalling
      activity. In contrast to wild type littermates, activin betaA subunit
      knockout (Inhba(-/-)) mice have significantly smaller testes at birth,
      attributable to 50% lower Sertoli cell number and decreased Sertoli cell
      proliferation from E13.5. Inhba(-/-) testes contained twice the normal
      gonocyte number at birth, with some appearing to bypass quiescence.
      Persistence of widespread P-SMAD 2/3 in Inhba(-/-) cells indicates other
      TGFB superfamily ligands are active in fetal testes. Significant
      differences in Smad and cell cycle regulator transcript levels correlating
      to Inhba gene dosage correspond to differences in Sertoli and germ cell
      numbers. In Inhba(-/-) testes, Cdkn1a (encoding p21(cip1)), identified
      previously in fetal gonocytes, was lower at E13.5, while Cdkn1b (encoding
      p(27kip1) in somatic cells) was lower at birth, and cyclin D2 mRNA and
      protein were lower at E15.5 and 0 dpp. Thus activin A dosage contributes
      to establishing the balance between Sertoli and germ cell number that is
      ultimately required for adult male fertility.

TI  - Histone demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B is a corepressor of TIEG1/KLF10.
AB  - JARID1B/KDM5B (jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1B/lysine-specific
      demethylase 5B) is an enzyme that efficiently removes methyl residues from
      trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3, a pivotal mark for active chromatin.
      TIEG1/KLF10 (transforming growth factor-beta inducible early
      gene-1/Kruppel-like transcription factor 10) is a zinc-finger
      transcription factor that is involved in bone metabolism and exerts
      antiproliferative activity. Here, we found that TIEG1 interacts with
      JARID1B. In particular, the repression domains of TIEG1 bind to the
      C-terminus of JARID1B. Moreover, overexpression of JARID1B augments TIEG1
      to repress transcription of Smad7, an inhibitor of the TGF-beta
      (transforming growth factor-beta) signaling pathway. Conversely, JARID1B
      knock-down leads to increased Smad7 mRNA levels. Thus, TIEG1 and JARID1B
      may cooperate to suppress tumorigenesis by enhancing TGF-beta signaling.
      Notably, both TIEG1 and JARID1B are downregulated in melanomas, suggesting
      that they indeed cooperate physiologically. In conclusion, JARID1B is the
      first TIEG1 corepressor identified, explaining how TIEG1 represses
      transcription through inducing histone H3 lysine 4 demethylation, which
      may be important for TIEG1 function in both normal and cancer cells.

TI  - Identification and analysis of type II TGF-{beta} receptors in
      BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem
      cells.
PG  - 699-708
AB  - Our previous studies have demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein 9
      (BMP-9) is one of the most efficacious BMPs to induce osteoblast
      differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the molecular
      mechanism underlying the BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs
      remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, dominant negative (DN) type
      II TGF-beta receptors were constructed and introduced into C3H10T1/2 stem
      cells, then in vitro and in vivo assays were carried out to analyze and
      identify the type II TGF-beta receptors required for BMP-9-induced
      osteogenesis. We found that three DN type II TGF-beta receptors,
      DN-BMPRII, DN-ActRII, and DN-ActRIIB, diminished BMP-9-induced alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) activity, led to a decrease in BMP-9-induced Smad
      binding element (SBE)-controled reporter activity, reduced BMP-9-induced
      expressions of Smad6 and Smad7, and decreased BMP-9-induced mineralization
      in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo, finally resulted in decreased
      bone masses and immature osteogenesis. These findings strongly suggested
      that three wild-type II TGF-beta receptors, BMPRII, ActRII and ActRIIB,
      may play a functional role in BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of
      C3H10T1/2 cells. However, C3H10T1/2 stem cells can express BMPRII and
      ActRII, but not ActRIIB. Using RNA interference (RNAi), we found that
      luciferase reporter activity and ALP activity induced by BMP-9 were
      accordingly inhibited along with the knockdown of BMPRII and ActRII. Taken
      together, our results demonstrated that BMPRII and ActRII are the
      functional type II TGF-beta receptors in BMP-9-induced osteogenic
      differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells.

AB  - The list of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-related proteins in
      non-canonical TGF-beta signaling is growing. Examples include
      receptor-Smads directing micro-RNA processing and inhibitory-Smads, e.g.
      Smad7, directing cell adhesion. Human skin grafts with fluorescently
      tagged melanoma cells revealed Smad7-expressing cells positioned
      themselves proximal to the dermal-epidermal junction and failed to form
      tumors, while control cells readily invaded and formed tumors within the
      dermis. Smad7 significantly inhibited beta-catenin T41/S45 phosphorylation
      associated with degradation and induced a 4.5-fold increase in full-length
      N-cadherin. Cell adhesion assays confirmed a strong interaction between
      Smad7-expressing cells and primary dermal fibroblasts mediated via
      N-cadherin, while control cells were incapable of such interaction.
      Immunofluorescent analysis of skin grafts indicated N-cadherin homotypic
      interaction at the surface of both Smad7 cells and primary dermal
      fibroblasts, in contrast to control melanoma cells. We propose that Smad7
      suppresses beta-catenin degradation and promotes interaction with
      N-cadherin, stabilizing association with neighboring dermal fibroblasts,
      thus mitigating invasion.

TI  - Smad7 inhibits transforming growth factor-beta family type i receptors
      through two distinct modes of interaction.
PG  - 30804-13
AB  - The inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), i.e. Smad6 and Smad7, are negative
      regulators of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family signaling.
      I-Smads inhibit TGF-beta family signaling principally through physical
      interaction with type I receptors (activin receptor-like kinases), so as
      to compete with receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) for activation.
      However, how I-Smads interact with type I receptors is not well
      understood. In the present study, we found that Smad7 has two modes of
      interaction with type I receptors. One is through a three-finger-like
      structure in the MH2 domain, consisting of residues 331-361, 379-387, and
      the L3 loop. The other is through a basic groove in the MH2 domain
      (Mochizuki, T., Miyazaki, H., Hara, T., Furuya, T., Imamura, T., Watabe,
      T., and Miyazono, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 31568-31574). We also
      found that Smad6 principally utilizes a basic groove in the MH2 domain for
      interaction with type I receptors. Smad7 thus has an additional mode of
      interaction with TGF-beta family type I receptors not possessed by Smad6,
      which may play roles in mediating the inhibitory effects unique to Smad7.

TI  - Murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 stimulates TGF-beta signaling in
      a kinase-dependent manner via direct phosphorylation of Smad proteins.
PG  - 30959-70
AB  - The present study demonstrated that murine protein serine/threonine kinase
      38 (MPK38) coimmunoprecipitates with Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7)
      and that this association is mediated by the catalytic kinase domain of
      MPK38. The association between MPK38 and Smad2, -3, and -4 was
      significantly increased by TGF-beta or ASK1 signals, whereas these signals
      decreased association of MPK38 with Smad7. MPK38 stimulated
      TGF-beta-induced transcription required for TGF-beta-mediated biological
      functions, such as apoptosis and cell growth arrest, in a kinase-dependent
      manner. Knockdown of endogenous MPK38 showed an opposite effect,
      inhibiting TGF-beta signaling. MPK38-mediated phosphorylation of Smad
      proteins (Ser(245) of Smad2, Ser(204) of Smad3, Ser(343) of Smad4, and
      Thr(96) of Smad7) was also found to be crucial to the positive regulation
      of TGF-beta signaling induced by MPK38. In addition, MPK38 enhanced
      nuclear translocation of Smad3, as well as redistribution of Smad7 from
      the nucleus to the cytoplasm, in response to TGF-beta. Together, these
      results indicate that MPK38 functions as a stimulator of TGF-beta
      signaling through direct interaction with and phosphorylation of Smad
      proteins.

TI  - miR-21 mediates fibrogenic activation of pulmonary fibroblasts and lung
      fibrosis.
PG  - 1589-97
AB  - Uncontrolled extracellular matrix production by fibroblasts in response to
      tissue injury contributes to fibrotic diseases, such as idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and ultimately fatal process that
      currently has no cure. Although dysregulation of miRNAs is known to be
      involved in a variety of pathophysiologic processes, the role of miRNAs in
      fibrotic lung diseases is unclear. In this study, we found up-regulation
      of miR-21 in the lungs of mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis and also in
      the lungs of patients with IPF. Increased miR-21 expression was primarily
      localized to myofibroblasts. Administration of miR-21 antisense probes
      diminished the severity of experimental lung fibrosis in mice, even when
      treatment was started 5-7 d after initiation of pulmonary injury.
      TGF-beta1, a central pathological mediator of fibrotic diseases, enhanced
      miR-21 expression in primary pulmonary fibroblasts. Increasing miR-21
      levels promoted, whereas knocking down miR-21 attenuated, the
      pro-fibrogenic activity of TGF-beta1 in fibroblasts. A potential mechanism
      for the role of miR-21 in fibrosis is through regulating the expression of
      an inhibitory Smad, Smad7. These experiments demonstrate an important role
      for miR-21 in fibrotic lung diseases and also suggest a novel approach
      using miRNA therapeutics in treating clinically refractory fibrotic
      diseases, such as IPF.

TI  - TGF-beta1 induces mouse dendritic cells to express VEGF and its receptor
      (Flt-1) under hypoxic conditions.
PG  - 606-13
AB  - Angiogenesis is a multi-step process that involves the activation,
      proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells. We have recently shown
      that TGF-beta1 can induce mouse macrophages to produce VEGF, a potent
      angiogenic factor. In the present study, we explored whether TGF-beta1 has
      a similar effect on mouse dendritic cells. First, we show that under
      hypoxic conditions, TGF-beta1 induced the expression of VEGF transcripts
      in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Overexpression of Smad3/4 further
      augmented TGF-beta1-induced VEGF transcription, while overexpression of
      DN-Smad3 decreased VEGF transcription in DC2.4 cells, a mouse dendritic
      cell line. We also show that TGF-beta1 and Smads are involved in the
      induction of VEGF protein secretion. Interestingly, under the same
      conditions, the expression of VEGF receptor 1 (Flt-1) was also elevated at
      both the transcriptional and protein levels. Additionally, we found that
      the TGF-beta1-induced VEGF secretion in activated DC2.4 cells has
      wound-healing properties. Finally, Smad7 and Smurf1 negatively regulated
      the TGF-beta1-induced and Smad3/4-mediated VEGF expression. Taken
      together, these results indicate that TGF-beta1 can enhance the expression
      of VEGF and Flt-1 through the typical Smad pathway in mouse dendritic
      cells.

TI  - Synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis induces alpha-smooth
      muscle actin in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells
      through a TGF-beta1-dependent mechanism.
PG  - 565-73
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disorder
      that causes the immune system to attack the joints. Transforming growth
      factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a secreted protein that promotes
      differentiation of synovial fibroblasts to alpha-smooth muscle actin
      (alpha-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts to repair the damaged joints. Synovial
      fluid from patients with RA (RA-SF) induced expression of alpha-SMA in
      human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). RA-SF-induced
      alpha-SMA expression was abrogated by immunodepletion of TGF-beta1 from
      RA-SF with anti-TGF-beta1 antibody. Furthermore, pretreatment of hASCs
      with the TGF-beta type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 or lentiviral small
      hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of TGF-beta type I receptor expression in
      hASCs blocked RA-SF-induced alpha-SMA expression. Small interfering
      RNA-mediated silencing of Smad2 or adenoviral overexpression of Smad7 (an
      inhibitory Smad isoform) completely inhibited RA-SF-stimulated alpha-SMA
      expression. These results suggest that TGF-beta1 plays a pivotal role in
      RA-SF-induced differentiation of hASCs to alpha-SMA-positive cells.

TI  - Expression of SMAD proteins, TGF-beta/activin signaling mediators, in
      human thyroid tissues.
PG  - 406-12
LID - S0004-27302010000400010 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of SMAD proteins in human thyroid
      tissues since the inactivation of TGF-beta/activin signaling components is
      reported in several types of cancer. Phosphorylated SMAD 2 and SMAD3
      (pSMAD2/3) associated with the SMAD4 induce the signal transduction
      generated by TGF-beta and activin, while SMAD7 inhibits this intracellular
      signaling. Although TGF-beta and activin exert antiproliferative roles in
      thyroid follicular cells, thyroid tumors express high levels of these
      proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protein expression of SMADs was
      evaluated in multinodular goiter, follicular adenoma, papillary and
      follicular carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression of
      pSMAD2/3, SMAD4 and SMAD7 was observed in both benign and malignant
      thyroid tumors. Although pSMAD2/3, SMAD4 and SMAD7 exhibited high
      cytoplasmic staining in carcinomas, the nuclear staining of pSMAD2/3 was
      not different between benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The
      finding of SMADs expression in thyroid cells and the presence of pSMAD2/3
      and SMAD4 proteins in the nucleus of tumor cells indicates propagation of
      TGF-beta/activin signaling. However, the high expression of the inhibitory
      SMAD7, mostly in malignant tumors, could contribute to the attenuation of
      the SMADs antiproliferative signaling in thyroid carcinomas.

TI  - Correlation between microRNA expression levels and clinical parameters
      associated with chronic hepatitis C viral infection in humans.
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression pathways.
      Previous studies have shown interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      and host miRNAs. We measured miR-122 and miR-21 levels in HCV-infected
      human liver biopsies relative to uninfected human livers and correlated
      these with clinical patient data. miR-122 is required for HCV replication
      in vitro, and miR-21 is involved in cellular proliferation and
      tumorigenesis. We found that miR-21 expression correlated with viral load,
      fibrosis and serum liver transaminase levels. miR-122 expression inversely
      correlated with fibrosis, liver transaminase levels and patient age.
      miR-21 was induced approximately twofold, and miR-122 was downregulated on
      infection of cultured cells with the HCV J6/JFH infectious clone, thus
      establishing a link to HCV. To further examine the relationship between
      fibrosis and the levels of miR-21 and miR-122, we measured their
      expression levels in a mouse carbon tetrachloride fibrosis model. As in
      the HCV-infected patient samples, fibrotic stage positively correlated
      with miR-21 and negatively correlated with miR-122 levels. Transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a critical mediator of fibrogenesis. We
      identified SMAD7 as a novel miR-21 target. SMAD7 is a negative regulator
      of TGF-beta signaling, and its expression is induced by TGF-beta. To
      confirm the relationship between miR-21 and the TGF-beta signaling
      pathway, we measured the effect of miR-21 on a TGF-beta-responsive
      reporter. We found that miR-21 enhanced TGF-beta signaling, further
      supporting a relationship between miR-21 and fibrosis. We suggest a model
      in which miR-21 targeting of SMAD7 could increase TGF-beta signaling,
      leading to increased fibrogenesis.Laboratory Investigation advance online

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-inducible gene TMEPAI converts
      TGF-beta from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter in breast cancer.
PG  - 6377-83
AB  - TMEPAI is a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced
      transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in several cancers. How TMEPAI
      expression relates to malignancy is unknown. Here, we report high
      expression of TMEPAI in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-negative
      and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative breast cancer cell
      lines and primary breast cancers that was further increased by TGF-beta
      treatment. Basal and TGF-beta-induced expression of TMEPAI were inhibited
      by the TGF-beta receptor antagonist SB431542 and overexpression of Smad7
      or a dominant-negative mutant of Alk-5. TMEPAI knockdown attenuated
      TGF-beta-induced growth and motility in breast cancer cells, suggesting a
      role for TMEPAI in growth promotion and invasiveness. Further, TMEPAI
      knockdown decreased breast tumor mass in a mouse xenograft model in a
      manner associated with increased expression of phosphatase and tensin
      homologue (PTEN) and diminished phosphorylation of Akt. Consistent with
      the effects through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, tumors with
      TMEPAI knockdown exhibited elevated levels of the cell cycle inhibitor
      p27kip1 and attenuated levels of DNA replication and expression of
      hypoxia-inducible fator 1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor.
      Together, these results suggest that TMEPAI functions in breast cancer as
      a molecular switch that converts TGF-beta from a tumor suppressor to a
      tumor promoter.

TI  - Essential role for Smad3 in angiotensin II-induced tubular
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
PG  - 390-401
AB  - Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a key mediator of chronic kidney disease, in
      which epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process
      mediated by the TGFbeta/Smad signalling pathway. The present study
      examined the specific role of Smads in Ang II-induced EMT in vitro and in
      vivo. We found that Ang II signalled through the receptor of AT1, not AT2,
      to activate Smad2/3 and induce EMT in a normal rat tubular epithelial cell
      line (NRK52E). Activation of Smads by Ang II was attributed to degradation
      of an inhibitory Smad7, which was mediated by the AT1-Smurf2-dependent
      ubiquitin degradation mechanism because blockade of AT1 receptor or
      knockdown of Smurf2 inhibited Smad7 loss, thereby reducing Smad2/3
      activation and EMT in response to Ang II. In contrast, over-expression of
      Smad7 inhibited Ang II-induced Smad2/3 activation and EMT in NRK52E cells
      and in a rat model of remnant kidney disease. Moreover, knockdown of
      Smad3, not Smad2, attenuated Ang II-induced EMT. In conclusion, Ang II
      activates Smad signalling to induce EMT, which is mediated by a loss of
      Smad7 through the AT1-Smurf2-dependent ubiquitin degradation pathway.
      Smad3, but not Smad2, may be a mediator of EMT, while Smad7 may play a
      protective role in EMT in response to Ang II.

TI  - T cell activation leads to protein kinase C theta-dependent inhibition of
      TGF-beta signaling.
PG  - 1568-76
AB  - TGF-beta is an ubiquitous cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the
      maintenance of self-tolerance and prevention of immunopathologies. Under
      steady-state conditions, TGF-beta keeps naive T cells in a resting state
      and inhibits Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation. Because rapid generation of
      Th1 and Th2 effector cells is needed in response to pathogen invasion, how
      do naive T cells escape from the quiescent state maintained by TGF-beta?
      We hypothesized that stimulation by strong TCR agonists might interfere
      with TGF-beta signaling. Using both primary mouse CD4(+) T cells and human
      Jurkat cells, we observed that strong TCR agonists swiftly suppress
      TGF-beta signaling. TCR engagement leads to a rapid increase in SMAD7
      levels and decreased SMAD3 phosphorylation. We present evidence that TCR
      signaling hinders SMAD3 activation by inducing recruitment of TGF-betaRs
      in lipid rafts together with inhibitory SMAD7. This effect is dependent on
      protein kinase C, a downstream TCR signaling intermediary, as revealed by
      both pharmacological inhibition and expression of dominant-negative and
      constitutively active protein kinase C mutants. This work broadens our
      understanding of the cross-talk occurring between the TCR and TGF-beta
      signaling pathways and reveals that strong TCR agonists can release CD4 T
      cells from constitutive TGF-beta signaling. We propose that this process
      may be of vital importance upon confrontation with microbial pathogens.

TI  - Tumor suppressor FLCN inhibits tumorigenesis of a FLCN-null renal cancer
      cell line and regulates expression of key molecules in TGF-beta signaling.
PG  - 160
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the FLCN gene are responsible for the
      development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and renal neoplasia in
      Birt-Hogg-Dube' (BHD) syndrome. The encoded protein folliculin (FLCN) is
      conserved across species but contains no classic motifs or domains and its
      function remains unknown. Somatic mutations or loss of heterozygosity in
      the remaining wild type copy of the FLCN gene have been found in renal
      tumors from BHD patients suggesting that FLCN is a classic tumor
      suppressor gene. RESULTS: To examine the tumor suppressor function of
      FLCN, wild-type or mutant FLCN (H255R) was stably expressed in a FLCN-null
      renal tumor cell line, UOK257, derived from a BHD patient. When these
      cells were injected into nude mice, tumor development was inversely
      dependent upon the level of wild-type FLCN expression. We identified genes
      that were differentially expressed in the cell lines with or without
      wild-type FLCN, many of which are involved in TGF-beta signaling,
      including TGF-beta2 (TGFB2), inhibin beta A chain (INHBA), thrombospondin
      1 (THBS1), gremlin (GREM1), and SMAD3. In support of the in vitro data,
      TGFB2, INHBA, THBS1 and SMAD3 expression levels were significantly lower
      in BHD-associated renal tumors compared with normal kidney tissue.
      Although receptor mediated SMAD phosphorylation was not affected, basal
      and maximal TGF-beta-induced levels of TGFB2, INHBA and SMAD7 were
      dramatically reduced in FLCN-null cells compared with FLCN-restored cells.
      Secreted TGF-beta2 and activin A (homo-dimer of INHBA) protein levels were
      also lower in FLCN-null cells compared with FLCN-restored cells.
      Consistent with a growth suppressive function, activin A (but not
      TGF-beta2) completely suppressed anchorage-independent growth of FLCN-null
      UOK257 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a role for FLCN in the
      regulation of key molecules in TGF-beta signaling and confirm deregulation
      of their expression in BHD-associated renal tumors. Thus, deregulation of
      genes involved in TGF-beta signaling by FLCN inactivation is likely to be
      an important step for tumorigenesis in BHD syndrome.

TI  - Smad3 regulates Rho signaling via NET1 in the transforming growth
      factor-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human retinal
      pigment epithelial cells.
PG  - 26618-27
AB  - We previously demonstrated that RhoA-dependent signaling regulates
      transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced cytoskeletal
      reorganization in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19.
      Smad pathways have also been shown to mediate TGF-beta1 activity. Here, we
      examined what regulates Rho GTPase activity and tested whether Smad
      signaling cross-talks with Rho pathways during TGF-beta1-induced actin
      rearrangement. Using small interfering RNAs, we found that NET1, the
      guanine nucleotide exchange factor of RhoA, is critical for
      TGF-beta1-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, N-cadherin expression, and
      RhoA activation. In ARPE-19 cells lacking NET1, TGF-beta1-induced stress
      fibers and N-cadherin expression were not observed. Interestingly, in
      dominant-negative Smad3-expressing or constitutively active Smad7 cells,
      TGF-beta1 failed to induce NET1 mRNA and protein expression. Consistent
      with these results, both dominant-negative Smad3 and constitutively active
      Smad7 blocked the cytoplasmic localization of NET1 and inhibited
      interactions between NET1 and RhoA. Finally, we found that NET1 is a
      direct gene target of TGF-beta1 via Smad3. Taken together, our results
      demonstrate that Smad3 regulates RhoA activation and cytoskeletal
      reorganization by controlling NET1 in TGF-beta1-induced ARPE-19 cells.
      These data define a new role for Smad3 as a modulator of RhoA activation
      in the regulation of TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.

TI  - Gypenosides inhibit renal fibrosis by regulating expression of related
      genes in rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction.
LID - D674E2D2-334D-421F-99A2-7F9127CA4EB0 [pii]
AB  - Background: Transforming growth factor ss1 (TGF-ss1), connective tissue
      growth factor (CTGF) and Smad7 are potent components of
      fibrogenesis-related signal transduction pathways. Renal fibrosis is the
      major pathological change in the rat models with unilateral ureteral
      obstruction (UUO). Investigating the effects of gypenosides (GPs) on the
      expression of fibrogenesis-related genes in the UUO model may lead to the
      development of effective therapy for renal diseases. Methods: Rats were
      randomly divided into 3 experimental groups: (i) sham operation rats
      treated with saline (sham group), (ii) UUO model rats treated with saline
      (control group) and (iii) UUO model rats treated with GPs (GPs group).
      Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were detected as the measurement
      of renal function. UUO-treated kidney tissues were taken for assessment of
      renal damage index and determination of related gene expression through
      immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Results: UUO-induced tubulointerstitial
      damage and fibrosis were attenuated by the application of GPs (day 3 and
      day 7, p<0.01; day 14, p<0.05). The expression of TGF-ss1 and CTGF was
      significantly reduced with GPs treatment (TGF-ss1, p<0.01; CTGF, p<0.05).
      Smad7 expression was elevated with GPs treatment at days 7 and 14
      (p<0.01). GPs' protective effects on renal function were also demonstrated
      with this UUO model. Conclusions: These results suggest that UUO-induced
      tubulointerstitial fibrosis can be effectively attenuated by GPs
      application. GPs-mediated down-regulation of TGF-ss1 and CTGF and
      up-regulation of Smad7 are essential for their effects of
      antifibrogenesis.

TI  - Tgf-beta signaling alterations and colon cancer.
PG  - 85-103
AB  - Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death
      in the United States. Twin studies suggest that 35% of all colorectal
      cancer cases are inherited. High-penetrance tumor susceptibility genes
      account for at most 3-6% of all colorectal cancer cases and the remainder
      of the unexplained risk is likely due to a combination of low to moderate
      penetrance genes. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified
      several SNPs near genes belonging to the transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta) superfamily such as GREM1 and SMAD7. Together with the recent
      discovery that constitutively decreased TGFBR1 expression is a potent
      modifier of colorectal cancer risk, these findings strongly suggest that
      germline variants of the TGF-beta superfamily may account for a sizeable
      proportion of colorectal cancer cases. The TGF-beta superfamily signaling
      pathways mediate many different biological processes during embryonic
      development, and in adult organisms they play a role in tissue
      homeostasis. TGF-beta has a central role in inhibiting cell proliferation
      and also modulates processes such as cell invasion, immune regulation, and
      microenvironment modification. Mutations in the TGF-beta type II receptor
      (TGFBR2) are estimated to occur in approximately 30% of colorectal
      carcinomas. Mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A are found in patients with
      familial juvenile polyposis, an autosomal dominant condition associated
      with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. This chapter provides an
      overview of the genetic basis of colorectal cancer and discusses recent
      discoveries related to alterations in the TGF-beta pathways and their role
      in the development of colorectal cancer.

TI  - Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) in TGF-beta signaling.
PG  - 857-60
AB  - Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) is known as Smad cofactor that
      interacts directly with Smad2/3 and functions to recruit Smad2/3 to the
      TGF-beta receptor. SARA plays an essential role in TGF-beta-induced Smad2
      activation and it may modulate TGF-beta signaling through regulating the
      balance between Smad2 and Smad3. SARA also functions as an anchor for
      catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) and maybe involved in
      the dephosphorylation of TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaR-I) mediated by
      Smad7. The expression of SARA changes as the development of epithelial to
      mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis and it plays a critical role in
      the maintenance of epithelial cell phenotype. Modulation of SARA may
      provide a new therapeutic approach to TGF-beta-mediated EMT and fibrosis.

TI  - Downregulation of ZEB1 and overexpression of Smad7 contribute to
      resistance to TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression in adult T-cell
      leukemia/lymphoma.
PG  - 4157-69
AB  - Zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) is a candidate
      tumor-suppressor gene in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). ZEB1 binds
      phosphorylated Smad2/3 to enhance transforming growth factor-beta1
      (TGF-beta1) signaling. In addition to downregulation of ZEB1 mRNA, we
      found overexpression of inhibitory Smad, Smad7, in resistance of ATLL
      cells to growth suppression by TGF-beta1. A protein complex of Smad7 and
      histone deacetylase constantly bound to the promoter region of TGF-beta1
      responsive genes with the Smad-responsive element (SRE) to inhibit
      TGF-beta1 signaling; however, ectopic expression of ZEB1 reactivated
      TGF-beta1 signaling by binding to Smad7 and recruiting the Smad3/p300
      histone acetyltransferase complex to the promoter after TGF-beta1
      stimulation in ATLL. Conversely, because ZEB1 mRNA was detected in the
      late stages of T-cell development, we used CTLL2 cells with ZEB1
      expression, a murine peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and found that a complex
      of Smad3, Smad7 and ZEB1 was bound to the SRE of the p21(CDKN1A) promoter
      after the induction of Smad7 by TGF-beta1 treatment. Because the duration
      of TGF-beta1-induced transcriptional activation of PAI-1 and p21 was
      shortened in shZEB1-expressing CTLL2 cells, ZEB1 may have a role in
      enhancing TGF-beta1 signaling by binding not only to Smad3 but also to
      Smad7 in the nucleus. Altogether, these results suggest that both ZEB1
      downregulation and Smad7 overexpression contribute to resistance to
      TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression in ATLL.

TI  - Trps1 haploinsufficiency promotes renal fibrosis by increasing Arkadia
      expression.
PG  - 1468-76
AB  - Mutations in TRPS1 cause tricho-rhino-pharyngeal syndrome (TRPS). Trps1 is
      essential for nephron development, acting downstream of Bmp7. Because Bmp7
      counteracts epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reverses
      chronic renal injury, we examined the function of Trps1 in renal fibrosis.
      Immunohistochemistry revealed Trps1 expression in proximal tubular
      epithelial cells of mice. Unilateral ureteral obstruction reduced mRNA and
      protein expression of Trps1 in wild-type and heterozygous Trps1-knockout
      (Trps1(+/-)) mice. Trps1 haploinsufficiency promoted tubulointerstitial
      fibrosis via increased phosphorylation of Smad3 and decreased Smad7
      protein. In primary culture, Trps1 deficiency promoted TGF-beta1-mediated
      EMT in proximal tubule cells. Trps1(+/-)-derived cells had higher levels
      of phosphorylated Smad3, and TGF-beta1 induced a time-dependent decrease
      in Smad7 protein in wild-type and Trps1(+/-) kidneys. In addition,
      compared with wild-type cells, Trps1(+/-) cells had double the amount of
      the E3 ubiquitin ligase Arkadia, and TGF-beta1 induced further Arkadia
      expression. Furthermore, knockdown of Arkadia inhibited TGF-beta1-induced
      EMT in Trps1(+/-) cells. Collectively, these data suggest that Trps1
      haploinsufficiency enhances TGF-beta1-induced EMT and tubulointerstitial
      fibrosis by modulating the amount of Smad7 through
      Arkadia/ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

TI  - miR-192 mediates TGF-beta/Smad3-driven renal fibrosis.
PG  - 1317-25
AB  - TGF-beta/Smad3 promotes renal fibrosis, but the mechanisms that regulate
      profibrotic genes remain unclear. We hypothesized that miR-192, a microRNA
      expressed in the kidney may mediate renal fibrosis in a Smad3-dependent
      manner. Microarray and real-time PCR demonstrated a tight association
      between upregulation of miR-192 in the fibrotic kidney and activation of
      TGF-beta/Smad signaling. Deletion of Smad7 promoted miR-192 expression and
      enhanced Smad signaling and fibrosis in obstructive kidney disease. In
      contrast, overexpression of Smad7 to block TGF-beta/Smad signaling
      inhibited miR-192 expression and renal fibrosis in the rat 5/6 nephrectomy
      model; in vitro, overexpression of Smad7 in tubular epithelial cells
      abolished TGF-beta1-induced miR-192 expression. Furthermore, Smad3 but not
      Smad2 mediated TGF-beta1-induced miR-192 expression by binding to the
      miR-192 promoter. Last, overexpression of a miR-192 mimic promoted and
      addition of a miR-192 inhibitor blocked TGF-beta1-induced collagen matrix
      expression. Taken together, miR-192 may be a critical downstream mediator
      of TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling in the development of renal fibrosis.

TI  - Smad7 regulates the adult neural stem/progenitor cell pool in a
      transforming growth factor beta- and bone morphogenetic
      protein-independent manner.
PG  - 3685-94
AB  - Members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family of
      proteins modulate the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of many
      different cell types. Neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) in the adult
      brain are inhibited in their proliferation by TGF-beta and by bone
      morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Here, we investigated neurogenesis in a
      hypomorphic mouse model for the TGF-beta and BMP inhibitor Smad7, with the
      hypothesis that NPC proliferation might be reduced due to increased
      TGF-beta and BMP signaling. Unexpectedly, we found enhanced NPC
      proliferation as well as an increased number of label-retaining cells in
      vivo. The enhanced proliferation potential of mutant cells was retained in
      vitro in neurosphere cultures. We observed a higher sphere-forming
      capacity as well as faster growth and cell cycle progression. Use of
      specific inhibitors revealed that these effects were independent of
      TGF-beta and BMP signaling. The enhanced proliferation might be at least
      partially mediated by elevated signaling via epidermal growth factor (EGF)
      receptor, as mutant cells showed higher expression and activation levels
      of the EGF receptor. Conversely, an EGF receptor inhibitor reduced the
      proliferation of these cells. Our data indicate that endogenous Smad7
      regulates neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation in a TGF-beta- and
      BMP-independent manner.

TI  - HDAC-mediated control of ERK- and PI3K-dependent TGF-beta-induced
      extracellular matrix-regulating genes.
PG  - 602-12
AB  - Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate the acetylation of histones in the
      control of gene expression. Many non-histone proteins are also targeted
      for acetylation, including TGF-beta signalling pathway components such as
      Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7. Our studies in mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts
      suggested that a number of TGF-beta-induced genes that regulate matrix
      turnover are selectively regulated by HDACs. Blockade of HDAC activity
      with trichostatin A (TSA) abrogated the induction of a disintegrin and
      metalloproteinase 12 (Adam12) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1
      (Timp-1) genes by TGF-beta, whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
      (Pai-1) expression was unaffected. Analysis of the activation of cell
      signalling pathways demonstrated that TGF-beta induced robust ERK and PI3K
      activation with delayed kinetics compared to the phosphorylation of Smads.
      The TGF-beta induction of Adam12 and Timp-1 was dependent on such non-Smad
      signalling pathways and, importantly, HDAC inhibitors completely blocked
      their activation without affecting Smad signalling. Analysis of
      TGF-beta-induced Adam12 and Timp-1 expression and ERK/PI3K signalling in
      the presence of semi-selective HDAC inhibitors valproic acid, MS-275 and
      apicidin implicated a role for class I HDACs. Furthermore, depletion of
      HDAC3 by RNA interference significantly down-regulated TGF-beta-induced
      Adam12 and Timp-1 expression without modulating Pai-1 expression.
      Correlating with the effect of HDAC inhibitors, depletion of HDAC3 also
      blocked the activation of ERK and PI3K by TGF-beta. Collectively, these
      data confirm that HDACs, and in particular HDAC3, are required for
      activation of the ERK and PI3K signalling pathways by TGF-beta and for the
      subsequent gene induction dependent on these signalling pathways.

TI  - Smad2 and Smad6 as predictors of overall survival in oral squamous cell
      carcinoma patients.
PG  - 106
AB  - BACKGROUND: To test if the expression of Smad1-8 mRNAs were predictive of
      survival in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: We analyzed, prospectively, the expression of Smad1-8, by means
      of Ribonuclease Protection Assay in 48 primary, operable, oral SCC. In
      addition, 21 larynx, 10 oropharynx and 4 hypopharynx SCC and 65 matched
      adjacent mucosa, available for study, were also included. For survival
      analysis, patients were categorized as positive or negative for each Smad,
      according to median mRNA expression. We also performed real-time
      quantitative PCR (QRTPCR) to asses the pattern of TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2,
      TGFbeta3 in oral SCC. RESULTS: Our results showed that Smad2 and Smad6
      mRNA expression were both associated with survival in Oral SCC patients.
      Cox Multivariate analysis revealed that Smad6 positivity and Smad2
      negativity were both predictive of good prognosis for oral SCC patients,
      independent of lymph nodal status (P = 0.003 and P = 0.029, respectively).
      In addition, simultaneously Smad2- and Smad6+ oral SCC group of patients
      did not reach median overall survival (mOS) whereas the mOS of
      Smad2+/Smad6- subgroup was 11.6 months (P = 0.004, univariate analysis).
      Regarding to TGFbeta isoforms, we found that Smad2 mRNA and TGFbeta1 mRNA
      were inversely correlated (p = 0.05, R = -0.33), and that seven of the
      eight TGFbeta1+ patients were Smad2-. In larynx SCC, Smad7- patients did
      not reach mOS whereas mOS of Smad7+ patients were only 7.0 months (P =
      0.04). No other correlations were found among Smad expression,
      clinico-pathological characteristics and survival in oral, larynx,
      hypopharynx, oropharynx or the entire head and neck SCC population.
      CONCLUSION: Smad6 together with Smad2 may be prognostic factors,
      independent of nodal status in oral SCC after curative resection. The
      underlying mechanism which involves aberrant TGFbeta signaling should be
      better clarified in the future.

TI  - Trigenic neural crest-restricted Smad7 over-expression results in
      congenital craniofacial and cardiovascular defects.
PG  - 233-47
AB  - Smad7 is a negative regulator of TGFbeta superfamily signaling. Using a
      three-component triple transgenic system, expression of the inhibitory
      Smad7 was induced via doxycycline within the NCC lineages at pre- and
      post-migratory stages. Consistent with its role in negatively regulating
      both TGFbeta and BMP signaling in vitro, induction of Smad7 within the NCC
      significantly suppressed phosphorylation levels of both Smad1/5/8 and
      Smad2/3 in vivo, resulting in subsequent loss of NCC-derived craniofacial,
      pharyngeal and cardiac OFT cushion cells. At the cellular level, increased
      cell death was observed in pharyngeal arches. However, cell proliferation
      and NCC-derived smooth muscle differentiation were unaltered. NCC lineage
      mapping demonstrated that cardiac NCC emigration and initial migration
      were not affected, but subsequent colonization of the OFT was
      significantly reduced. Induction of Smad7 in post-migratory NCC resulted
      in interventricular septal chamber septation defects, suggesting that
      TGFbeta superfamily signaling is also essential for cardiac NCC at
      post-migratory stages to govern normal cardiac development. Taken
      together, the data illustrate that tightly regulated TGFbeta superfamily
      signaling plays an essential role during craniofacial and cardiac NCC
      colonization and cell survival in vivo.

      diseases) with anti-oxidative and cell protective properties. Sal B also
      has potential protective effects on renal diseases. Tubular epithelial
      cells can undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which plays
      an important role in the pathogenesis of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF)
      and is mainly regulated by TGF-beta1/Smads pathway. The aims of the study
      are to investigate the effect of Sal B on tubular EMT in vivo and in
      vitro, and to elucidate its underlying mechanism against EMT related to
      TGF-beta1/Smads pathway. RESULTS: For in vivo experiments, RIF was induced
      in rats by oral administration of HgCl2 and prophylaxised with Sal B and
      vitamin E. The protein expression of E-cadherin was down-regulated, while
      the expression of alpha-SMA, TGF-beta1, TbetaR-I, p-Smad2/3 and the
      activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were up-regulated in
      kidneys of model rats when compared with those of normal rats. In
      contrast, Sal B and vitamin E significantly attenuated the expression of
      alpha-SMA, TGF-beta1, TbetaR-I, p-Smad2/3, and MMP-2 activity, but
      increased E-cadherin expression. For in vitro experiments, HK-2 cells were
      incubated with TGF-beta1 to induce EMT, and the cells were co-cultured
      with 1 and 10 microM Sal B or SB-431542 (a specific inhibitor of TbetaR-I
      kinase). TGF-beta1 induced a typical EMT in HK-2 cells, while it was
      blocked by Sal B and SB-431542, as evidenced by blocking morphologic
      transformation, restoring E-cadherin and CK-18 expression, inhibiting
      alpha-SMA expression and F-actin reorganization, and down-regulating
      MMP-2/9 activities in TGF-beta1 mediated HK-2 cells. Furthermore, Sal B
      and SB-431542 profoundly down-regulated the expressions of TbetaR-I and
      p-Smad2/3 but prevented the decreased expression of Smad7 in TGF-beta1
      stimulated HK-2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Sal B can prevent tubular EMT in the
      fibrotic kidney induced by HgCl2 as well as HK-2 cells triggered by
      TGF-beta1, the mechanism of Sal B is closely related to the regulation of
      TGF-beta1/Smads pathway, manifested as the inhibition of TGF-beta1
      expression, suppression of TbetaR-I expression and function,
      down-regulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and restoration of the
      down-regulation of Smad7, as well as inhibition of MMP-2 activity.

TI  - Alleviation of CCl4-induced cirrhosis in rats by tetramethylpyrazine is
      associated with downregulation of leptin and TGF-beta1 pathway.
PG  - 310-5
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effect of tetramethylpyrazine
      (TMP) on CCl(4)-induced fibrosis in rats and the possible roles of leptin,
      TGF-beta1, Smad3, and Smad7 in this process. Liver fibrosis in rats was
      induced by the subcutaneous injection of 60% CCl(4) (0.3 mL /100 g body
      weight, biweekly ) for 12 weeks. Rats in TMP prevention and treatment
      groups were given TMP (10 mg /100 g body weight, daily) by gavage from
      days 1 and 31 after the start of CCl(4) injection, respectively. The mRNA
      expression of leptin, OB-Rb, TGF-beta1, and TGF-beta RII in the liver were
      detected by RT-PCR, whereas Smad3 and Smad7 protein were determined by
      Western blot. The results showed that hepatic cirrhosis was obviously
      alleviated in both TMP prevention and treatment groups. The mRNA
      expression of leptin, OB-Rb, TGF-beta1 and -beta RII, and Smad3 protein
      were higher in the cirrhotic models. In TMP prevention and treatment
      groups, these markers of expression were higher, compared with that of the
      normal control, but were lower when compared with that of the cirrhotic
      model group. Smad7 protein expression was lower in the cirrhotic model
      group than in the normal control. Smad7 expression in TMP prevention and
      treatment groups was higher, compared with that in the cirrhotic model
      group. Liver collagen in the TMP prevention group was the lowest among all
      CCl(4) injection groups. In conclusion, TMP can prevent and alleviate the
      development of liver fibrosis in rats. The possible mechanism could
      involve the downregulation of leptin, Ob-Rb, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta RII, and
      Samd3, and upregulation of Smad7.
