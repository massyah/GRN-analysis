TI  - Simvastatin induces Foxp3+ T regulatory cells by modulation of
      transforming growth factor-beta signal transduction.
PG  - 484-93
AB  - Statins are widely used drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.
      A number of recent studies have suggested that statins also have
      pleiotropic effects on immune responses and statins have proven to be
      effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in animal models.
      Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells are a unique subset of CD4(+) T cells that
      mediate immunosuppression. Foxp3(+) T cells develop in the thymus, but can
      also be induced in peripheral sites in the presence of transforming growth
      factor-beta (TGF-beta). We demonstrate here that simvastatin blockade of
      the mevalonate pathway can mediate induction of mouse Foxp3(+) T cells and
      that simvastatin can synergize with low levels of TGF-beta to induce
      Foxp3(+) T cells. The effects of simvastatin are secondary to a blockade
      of protein geranylgeranylation, are mediated at late time-points after
      T-cell activation, and are associated with demethylation of the Foxp3
      promoter. One major effect of simvastatin was inhibition of the induction
      of Smad6 and Smad7, inhibitory Smads that inhibit TGF-beta signalling. Our
      results suggest that one mechanism responsible for the immunosuppressive
      effects of statins is the ability to promote the generation of Foxp3(+) T
      regulatory cells.

TI  - Docosahexaenoic acid reduces suppressive and migratory functions of
      CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells.
PG  - 2377-88
AB  - Immunological tolerance is one of the fundamental aspects of the immune
      system. The CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells have emerged as key
      players in the development of tolerance to self and foreign antigens.
      However, little is known about the endogenous factors and mechanisms
      controlling their suppressive capacity on immune response. In this study,
      we observed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acid, diminished, in a dose-dependent manner, the capacity of Treg cells
      to inhibit the CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T-cell proliferation. DHA not only
      reduced the migration of Treg cells toward chemokines but also
      downregulated the mRNA expression of CCR-4 and CXCR-4 in Treg cells. DHA
      also curtailed ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation and downregulated the Smad7
      levels in these cells. Contradictorily, DHA upregulated the mRNA
      expression of Foxp3, CTLA-4, TGF-beta, and IL-10; nonetheless, this fatty
      acid increased the expression of p27(KIP1) mRNA, known to be involved in
      Treg cell unresponsiveness. In Foxp3-immunoprepitated nuclear proteins,
      DHA upregulated histone desacetylase 7 levels that would again participate
      in the unresposnsiveness of these cells. Finally, a DHA-enriched diet also
      diminished, ex vivo, the suppressive capacity of Treg cells. Altogether,
      these results suggest that DHA, by diminishing Treg cell functions, may
      play a key role in health and disease.

TI  - Smad7 controls resistance of colitogenic T cells to regulatory T
      cell-mediated suppression.
PG  - 1308-16, e1-3
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key
      role in the maintenance of the gut immune homeostasis, and an intact
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling is required for their
      function. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the TGF-beta signaling is
      impaired because of high expression of the inhibitory molecule Smad7.
      Although no intrinsic defects in Tregs function have been shown in IBD, it
      is still unknown whether colitogenic T cells are susceptible to
      Treg-mediated suppression. In this study, we have investigated whether IBD
      mucosal CD4+ T cells are resistant to Tregs and whether Smad7 is involved
      in this process. METHODS: IBD lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were
      cultured with or without Tregs, and proliferation was assessed by flow
      cytometry. Proliferation of IBD LPMC was also evaluated after Smad7
      antisense oligonuclotide treatment. Treg-mediated suppression of T-cell
      proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine expression was investigated in
      murine Smad7 transgenic cells. In vivo, the Smad7-dependent resistance of
      colitogenic naive T cells to Tregs was studied in the adoptive transfer
      model of colitis. RESULTS: IBD LPMC were resistant to Treg-mediated
      suppression, and this phenomenon was reverted by Smad7 antisense
      treatment. Consistently, CD4+ T cells isolated from Smad7 transgenic mice
      showed high proliferation, produced considerable amount of inflammatory
      cytokines following activation, and induced a severe colitis when
      transferred in immunodeficient RAG1 knockout mice even in the presence of
      wild-type Tregs. CONCLUSIONS: Smad7 makes CD4+ T cells resistant to
      Tregs-mediated suppression thus fine-tuning their proinflammatory
      potential.

TI  - Transient local depletion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells during recovery
      from colitis via Fas/Fas ligand-induced death.
PG  - 8316-26
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a fundamental role in regulating the
      immune system in health and disease. Considerable evidence exists
      demonstrating that transfer of Tregs can cure colitis and a variety of
      other inflammatory disorders. However, little is known about the effects
      of inflammation on resident Tregs. Mice (BALB/c or C57BL/6) treated with
      an intrarectal instillation of the haptenizing agent 2,4-dinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid (DNBS) develop an acute inflammatory disease, the
      histopathology of which peaks at 3 days posttreatment and resolves
      spontaneously thereafter. In this study we demonstrate that DNBS (or
      oxazolone)-induced colitis causes a depletion of colonic Foxp3+ Tregs 8
      days posttreatment, while the proportion of Foxp3+ cells in the ileum,
      mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen remains unchanged. Replenishment of the
      colonic Treg population was associated with the reappearance of mucosal
      homing (alpha4beta7+) CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs. Assessing the mechanism of local
      Treg depletion, we found no evidence to implicate cytokine-induced
      phenotypic switching in the Foxp3+ population or increased SMAD7
      expression despite the essential role that TGF-beta has in Foxp3+ Treg
      biology. Increased Fas ligand (FasL) expression was observed in the colon
      of colitic mice and in vitro stimulation with a Fas cross-linking Ab
      resulted in apoptosis of CD4+Foxp3+ but not CD4+Foxp3- cells. Furthermore,
      DNBS-induced colitis in Fas/FasL-deficient mice did not result in
      depletion of colonic Tregs. Finally, adoptively transferred synergic
      Fas-/- but not Fas+/+ Tregs were protected from depletion in the colon 8
      days post-DNBS treatment, thus substantiating the hypothesis that
      inflammation-induced local depletion of Foxp3+ Tregs in the colon of mice
      occurs via Fas/FasL-mediated death.

TI  - Dysregulation of TGF-beta signaling and regulatory and effector T-cell
      function in virus-induced neuroinflammatory disease.
PG  - 5601-9
AB  - We previously demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs),
      important for the maintenance of immune tolerance and prevention of
      autoimmune disease, from patients with human T lymphotropic virus type I
      (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)
      exhibit reduced Foxp3 expression and Treg suppressor function compared
      with healthy donors. Since TGF-beta signaling has been previously reported
      to be critical for both Foxp3 expression and Treg function, we examined
      whether this signaling pathway was dysregulated in patients with HAM/TSP.
      Levels of TGF-beta receptor II (TGF-betaRII) as well as Smad7 (a
      TGF-beta-inducible gene) were significantly reduced in CD4(+) T cells in
      patients with HAM/TSP compared with healthy donors, and the expression of
      TGF-betaRII inversely correlated with the HTLV-I tax proviral load.
      Importantly, both CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells from HAM/TSP
      patients exhibited reduced TGF-betaRII expression compared with healthy
      donors, which was associated with functional deficits in vitro, including
      a block in TGF-beta-inducible Foxp3 expression that inversely correlated
      with the HTLV-I tax proviral load, loss of Treg suppressor function, and
      escape of effector T cells from Treg-mediated control. This evidence
      suggests that a virus-induced breakdown of immune tolerance affecting both
      regulatory and effector T cells contributes to the pathogenesis of
      HAM/TSP.

TI  - Cutting edge: trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6R abrogates the
      induction of FoxP3 in naive CD4+CD25 T cells.
PG  - 2041-5
AB  - Chronic inflammatory diseases may develop when regulatory T cells (Tregs)
      fail to control the balance between tolerance and immunity. Alternatively,
      activated immune cells might prevent the induction or activation of Tregs
      in such diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that trans-signaling into
      T cells via the soluble IL-6 receptor completely abrogates the de novo
      induction of adaptive Tregs. Mechanistically, IL-6 trans-signaling
      augmented the expression of the TGF-beta signaling inhibitor SMAD7.
      Consequently, SMAD7 overexpression in T cells using newly created
      transgenic mice rendered CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells resistant to the induction
      of FoxP3. Finally, IL-6 trans-signaling inhibited Treg-mediated
      suppression in a murine model of colitis. In summary, IL-6 trans-signaling
      into T cells emerges as a key pathway for blockade of the development of
      adaptive Tregs and thus may play a pivotal role in shifting the balance
      between effector and regulatory T cell numbers in chronic inflammatory and
      autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Association between parasite infection and immune responses in multiple
      sclerosis.
PG  - 97-108
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether parasite infection is correlated with a
      reduced number of exacerbations and altered immune reactivity in multiple
      sclerosis (MS). METHODS: A prospective, double-cohort study was performed
      to assess the clinical course and radiological findings in 12 MS patients
      presenting associated eosinophilia. All patients presented parasitic
      infections with positive stool specimens. In all parasite-infected MS
      patients, the eosinophilia was not present during the 2 previous years.
      Eosinophil counts were monitored at 3- to 6-month intervals. When counts
      became elevated, patients were enrolled in the study. Interleukin (IL)-4,
      IL-10, IL-12, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and interferon-gamma
      production by myelin basic protein-specific peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells were studied using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT). FoxP3 and
      Smad7 expression were studied by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
      reaction. RESULTS: During a 4.6-year follow-up period, parasite-infected
      MS patients showed a significantly lower number of exacerbations, minimal
      variation in disability scores, as well as fewer magnetic resonance
      imaging changes when compared with uninfected MS patients. Furthermore,
      myelin basic protein-specific responses in peripheral blood showed a
      significant increase in IL-10 and TGF-beta and a decrease in IL-12 and
      interferon-gamma-secreting cells in infected MS patients compared with
      noninfected patients. Myelin basic protein-specific T cells cloned from
      infected subjects were characterized by the absence of IL-2 and IL-4
      production, but high IL-10 and/or TGF-beta secretion, showing a cytokine
      profile similar to the T-cell subsets Tr1 and Th3. Moreover, cloning
      frequency of CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T cells was substantially increased in
      infected patients compared with uninfected MS subjects. Finally, Smad7
      messenger RNA was not detected in T cells from infected MS patients
      secreting TGF-beta. INTERPRETATION: Increased production of IL-10 and
      TGF-beta, together with induction of CD25+CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells, suggests
      that regulatory T cells induced during parasite infections can alter the
      course of MS.

TI  - Distinct expression profiles of TGF-beta1 signaling mediators in
      pathogenic SIVmac and non-pathogenic SIVagm infections.
PG  - 37
AB  - BACKGROUND: The generalized T-cell activation characterizing HIV-1 and
      SIVmac infections in humans and macaques (MACs) is not found in the
      non-pathogenic SIVagm infection in African green monkeys (AGMs). We have
      previously shown that TGF-beta1, Foxp3 and IL-10 are induced very early
      after SIVagm infection. In SIVmac-infected MACs, plasma TGF-beta1
      induction persists during primary infection 1. We raised the hypothesis
      that MACs are unable to respond to TGF-beta1 and thus cannot resorb
      virus-driven inflammation. We therefore compared the very early expression
      dynamics of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers as well as of factors
      involved in the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway in SIV-infected AGMs and MACs.
      METHODS: Levels of transcripts encoding for pro- and anti-inflammatory
      markers (tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il-10, t-bet, gata-3) as well as for
      TGF-beta1 signaling mediators (smad3, smad4, smad7) were followed by real
      time PCR in a prospective study enrolling 6 AGMs and 6 MACs. RESULTS:
      During primary SIVmac infection, up-regulations of tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma
      and t-bet responses (days 1-16 p.i.) were stronger whereas il-10 response
      was delayed (4th week p.i.) compared to SIVagm infection. Up-regulation of
      smad7 (days 3-8 p.i.), a cellular mediator inhibiting the TGF-beta1
      signaling cascade, characterized SIV-infected MACs. In AGMs, we found
      increases of gata-3 but not t-bet, a longer lasting up-regulation of smad4
      (days 1-21 p.i), a mediator enhancing TGF-beta1 signaling, and no smad7
      up-regulations. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the inability to resorb
      virus-driven inflammation and activation during the pathogenic
      HIV-1/SIVmac infections is associated with an unresponsiveness to
      TGF-beta1.

TI  - IL-17 and Th17 Cells.
PG  - 485-517
AB  - CD4+ T cells, upon activation and expansion, develop into different T helper cell
      subsets with different cytokine profiles and distinct effector functions. Until
      recently, T cells were divided into Th1 or Th2 cells, depending on the cytokines 
      they produce. A third subset of IL-17-producing effector T helper cells, called
      Th17 cells, has now been discovered and characterized. Here, we summarize the
      current information on the differentiation and effector functions of the Th17
      lineage. Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22, thereby inducing a massive 
      tissue reaction owing to the broad distribution of the IL-17 and IL-22 receptors.
      Th17 cells also secrete IL-21 to communicate with the cells of the immune system.
      The differentiation factors (TGF-beta plus IL-6 or IL-21), the growth and
      stabilization factor (IL-23), and the transcription factors (STAT3, RORgammat,
      and RORalpha) involved in the development of Th17 cells have just been
      identified. The participation of TGF-beta in the differentiation of Th17 cells
      places the Th17 lineage in close relationship with CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T
      cells (Tregs), as TGF-beta also induces differentiation of naive T cells into
      Foxp3+ Tregs in the peripheral immune compartment. The investigation of the
      differentiation, effector function, and regulation of Th17 cells has opened up a 
      new framework for understanding T cell differentiation. Furthermore, we now
      appreciate the importance of Th17 cells in clearing pathogens during host defense
      reactions and in inducing tissue inflammation in autoimmune disease.

TI  - IL-6-gp130-STAT3 in T cells directs the development of IL-17+ Th with a minimum
      effect on that of Treg in the steady state.
PG  - 695-702
AB  - IL-17-producing Th (Th17) comprise a distinct lineage of pro-inflammatory Th that
      are major contributors to autoimmune diseases. Treatment with IL-6 and
      transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induces naive CD4+ T cells to generate 
      Th17, which also requires expression of the IL-6/TGFbeta target RORgammat. We
      reported that IL-6 transduces two signaling pathways via tyrosine redidues of the
      signal transducer gp130: one depends on signal transducers and activators of
      transcription (STAT)-3 activation and the other on Src homology region 2
      domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2)/Grb2 associated binder
      (Gab)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Here, we showed that
      CD4+ T cells carrying a mutant gp130 that transduces the SHP2/Gab/MAPK pathway
      but not the STAT3-mediated one failed to develop into Th17, while CD4+ T cells
      whose mutant gp130 transduces the STAT3 signal only generated Th17, indicating
      that IL-6 acts directly on T cells through the tyrosine residues of gp130
      required for STAT3 activation to promote the development of Th17. Moreover, we
      found that gp130-STAT3 pathway is essential for Th17 development and for the
      expression of RORgammat by using T cells specifically lacking gp130 and STAT3.
      Noteworthy is that the regulatory T cell (Treg) percentages and numbers were
      comparable between all mutant mice we tested in vivo, although we showed that
      IL-6-gp130-STAT3 pathway suppressed Treg development in vitro. Thus, we conclude 
      that IL-6 acts directly to promote the development of Th17 by activating the T
      cell gp130-STAT3 pathway but has a minimum effect on Treg development at least in
      the steady state in vivo. Therefore, blockade of IL-6-gp130-STAT3 pathway in CD4+
      T cells could be a good target for controlling unwanted Th17-mediated immune
      responses including autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Cutting edge: TGF-beta induces a regulatory phenotype in CD4+CD25- T cells
      through Foxp3 induction and down-regulation of Smad7.
PG  - 5149-53
AB  - CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory cells are a subpopulation of T lymphocytes of thymic
      origin. However, recent data suggest an alternative commitment of regulatory T
      cells in the periphery, although the precise mechanism is unknown. In the present
      work, we demonstrate that TGF-beta is able to induce Foxp3 expression and
      subsequently a regulatory phenotype in CD4(+)CD25(-) peripheral murine T cells.
      Similarly, TGF-beta induced Foxp3 in human CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells. Moreover, we
      show that the inhibitory Smad7 protein that is normally induced by TGF-beta and
      limits TGF-beta signaling, is strongly down-regulated by Foxp3 at the
      transcriptional level. Foxp3-mediated down-regulation of Smad7 subsequently
      rendered CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells highly susceptible to the morphogenic and
      regulatory effects of TGF-beta signaling via Smad3/4. In summary, we demonstrate 
      that TGF-beta induces a regulatory phenotype in CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells through the
      induction of Foxp3 and a positive autoregulatory loop of TGF-beta signaling due
      to the absence of Smad7.
