TI  - Granulysin Production and Anticryptococcal Activity Is Dependent upon a
      Far Upstream Enhancer That Binds STAT5 in Human Peripheral Blood CD4+ T
      Cells.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that STAT5 is critical for expression
      of granulysin and antimicrobial activity. Because the signaling pathway
      and the resultant microbicidal activity are defective in HIV-infected
      patients, the mechanism by which STAT5 leads to granulysin expression is
      of great interest. In the current study, IL-2-stimulated CRL-2105 CD4(+) T
      cells expressed granulysin and killed Cryptococcus neoformans similar to
      primary CD4(+) T cells. The enhancer activity of the upstream element of
      the granulysin promoter was analyzed in primary CD4(+) T cells and
      CRL-2105 T cells with a luciferase reporter assay, and a STAT5 binding
      site, 18,302 to 18,177 bp upstream of the transcription start site, was
      identified as an enhancer. Additionally, the enhancer functioned in the
      context of heterologous SV40 promoter irrespective of its transcriptional
      orientation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSAs demonstrated that the
      enhancer element bound STAT5 both in vivo and in vitro, and mutation of
      the STAT5 binding site abrogated its enhancer activity. Furthermore,
      overexpression of a dominant negative STAT5a abolished the enhancer
      activity of the STAT5 binding site and abrogated the anticryptococcal
      activity of IL-2-stimulated primary CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, these
      data provide details about the complex regulation leading to granulysin
      expression and anticryptococcal activity in primary CD4(+) T cells.

TI  - Rhizoctonia bataticola lectin (RBL) induces mitogenesis and cytokine
      production in human PBMC via p38 MAPK and STAT-5 signaling pathways.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhizoctonia bataticola lectin (RBL), purified from
      phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia bataticola is highly mitogenic towards
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The lectin has sugar
      specificity towards N-glycans and binds to glycoproteins containing
      complex N-glycans (Nagre et al., Glycoconj J. 2010). In this study, we
      investigated the role of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and
      Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT)-5 signaling in
      RBL-induced proliferation and production of Th1/Th2 cytokines. METHODS:
      Human PBMC were stimulated with RBL and proliferation was determined by
      tritiated thymidine incorporation assay, cytokine profiles by ELISA and
      activation of MAPK and STAT-5 by western blotting. RBL binding was
      monitored by immunofluorescence staining. Expression of IL-2Ralpha (CD25)
      was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The binding and mitogenic
      activities of RBL were inhibited by glycoproteins- mucin, asialofetuin and
      fetuin. RBL stimulated expression of IL-2Ralpha and production of Th1/Th2
      cytokines- IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10. RBL-induced phosphorylation of
      ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK was detected at 1h and 3h respectively. Significant
      phosphorylation of STAT-5 (tyr(694)) was observed at 12h. Pharmacological
      inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580) and JAK/STAT (AG490) but not ERK
      (PD98059) abrogated proliferation. RBL-induced expression of IL-2Ralpha
      and secretion of cytokines were drastically inhibited by SB203580 and
      AG490. CONCLUSIONS: RBL-induced proliferation and production of Th1/Th2
      cytokines are mediated via p38 MAPK and STAT-5 signaling. GENERAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: RBL, a complex sugar-inhibitable lectin is strongly
      mitogenic to human PBMC and stimulates the production of Th1 and Th2
      cytokines. The results identified the signaling mechanism underlying the
      immunostimulatory activity of RBL.

TI  - T lymphocytes from malnourished infants are short-lived and dysfunctional
      cells.
AB  - To investigate T-cell functional molecules and inflammatory cytokines and
      to assess T-cell apoptosis in malnourished infants, 64 infants from
      undernourished women and 28 healthy control infants were recruited to the
      study. Malnourished infants showed a significant decrease in the levels of
      circulating IL-2 and IL-7 and increases in the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6,
      IL-10 and TNF-alpha, as measured by flow cytometry. There was a
      significant reduction in the number of CD3(+) T cells and an increase in
      apoptotic T cells, which was associated with an up-regulation of CD95 and
      PD-1 expression on CD3(+) T cells in malnourished compared to control
      infants. Significant reductions were also observed in the phosphorylation
      of AKT and STAT5 and in the expression of CCR7 and CXCR4 receptors in
      malnourished children, and these reductions were associated with a
      significant reduction in T-cell migratory capacity to their ligands CCL21
      and CXCL12, respectively, as measured using an in vitro chemotaxis assay.
      Taken together, these data suggest that lymphocytes from malnourished
      infants are short-lived and dysfunctional.

TI  - A non-redundant role for OX40 in the competitive fitness of Treg in
      response to IL-2.
AB  - OX40 stimulation is known to enhance activation of effector T cells and to
      inhibit induction and suppressive function of Treg. Here we uncovered a
      novel role of OX40 in sustaining Treg competitive fitness in vivo, during
      repopulation of lymphopenic hosts and reconstitution of BM chimeras.
      Defective expansion of OX40-null Treg diminished their ability to suppress
      inflammation in a model of lymphopenia-driven colitis. OX40-mediated
      promotion of Treg fitness spanned beyond lymphopenic environments, as
      endogenous Treg in OX40-null mice showed decreased accumulation during
      thymic development, enhanced susceptibility to antibody-mediated depletion
      and defective turnover following thymectomy. In vitro, OX40-deficient Treg
      were found to be intrinsically hyporesponsive to IL-2, in terms of Stat5
      phosphorylation and proliferation, according to elevated SOCS1 content and
      reduced miR155 expression. Therefore, OX40 is a key factor in shaping Treg
      sensitivity to IL-2 and promoting their proliferation and survival, toward
      accurate immune regulation.

TI  - Intestinal CD4(+)CD25(high) regulatory T cells are expanded in ankylosing
      spondylitis patients: A putative role for IL-10 in preventing intestinal
      TH17 response.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: subclinical gut inflammation has been demonstrated in
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. Aim of this study was to determine
      the frequency of regulatory CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells (T(reg)), and to
      evaluate T(reg)-related cytokines (IL-2, TGF-beta, IL-10), and
      transcription factors (FOXP3 and STAT5) in the ileum of AS patients.
      METHODS:: Quantitative gene expression analysis, by rt-PCR, of
      T(reg)-related cytokines (IL-2, TGF-beta, IL-10) and transcription factor
      (STAT-5 and FOXP3) was performed on ileal biopsies of 18 AS and 15 active
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 15 healthy subjects (HS). Tissue and
      circulating T(reg) cells were also analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS:: A
      significant up-regulation of IL-2, TGF-beta, FOXP3, STAT-5 and IL-10
      transcripts in the terminal ileum of AS patients displaying chronic ileal
      inflammation was observed. Flow cytometric analysis of T(reg) cells showed
      significant peripheral expansion in both chronic inflamed AS and CD
      patients (1.08%+/-0.4% and 1.05+/-0.3% respectively), compared to HS
      (0.25+/-0.12; p<0.05). Interestingly a five-fold increase in the
      proportion of T(reg) cells was observed in the gut of AS patients (5+/-3%;
      p<0.001) compared to HS (1.2%+/-0.4%), with 70 to 80% of these cells also
      producing IL-10. In vitro studies showed that block of IL-10 was
      sufficient to induce Th17 polarization on isolated lamina propria
      mononuclear cells (LPMC) from AS patients. CONCLUSION:: Here we provide
      the first evidence that an active T(reg) cell response, mainly dominated
      by IL-10 production, occurs in the gut of AS patients, probably
      responsible for the absence of a clear TH17 polarization observed in the
      ileum of AS patients.

TI  - CD69 association with Jak3/Stat5 proteins regulates Th17 cell
      differentiation.
PG  - 4877-89
AB  - T-cell differentiation involves the early decision to commit to a
      particular pattern of response to an antigen. Here, we show that the
      leukocyte activation antigen CD69 limits differentiation into
      proinflammatory helper T cells (Th17 cells). Upon antigen stimulation in
      vitro, CD4(+) T cells from CD69-deficient mice generate an expansion of
      Th17 cells and the induction of greater mRNA expression of interleukin 17
      (IL-17), IL 23 receptor (IL-23R), and the nuclear receptor retinoic
      acid-related orphan receptor gammat (RORgammat). In vivo studies with
      CD69-deficient mice bearing OTII T-cell receptors (TCRs) specific for OVA
      peptide showed a high proportion of antigen-specific Th17 subpopulation in
      the draining lymph nodes, as well as in CD69-deficient mice immunized with
      type II collagen. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the CD69
      cytoplasmic tail associates with the Jak3/Stat5 signaling pathway, which
      regulates the transcription of RORgammat and, consequently,
      differentiation toward the Th17 lineage. Functional experiments in Th17
      cultures demonstrated that the selective inhibition of Jak3 activation
      enhanced the transcription of RORgammat. Moreover, the addition of
      exogenous IL-2 restored Stat5 phosphorylation and inhibited the enhanced
      Th17 differentiation in CD69-deficient cells. These results support the
      early activation receptor CD69 as an intrinsic modulator of the T-cell
      differentiation program that conditions immune inflammatory processes.

TI  - Organophosphorous pesticide metabolite (DEDTP) induces changes in the
      activation status of human lymphocytes by modulating the interleukin 2
      receptor signal transduction pathway.
PG  - 122-33
AB  - Diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP) is a metabolite formed by biotransformation
      of organophosphorous (OP) compounds that has a longer half-life than its
      parental compound. Here we evaluate the effects of DEDTP on human CD4+ T
      lymphocytes. In vitro exposure to DEDTP (1-50muM) decreased
      [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in resting cells and increased CD25 surface
      expression without altering cell viability. DEDTP treatment inhibited
      anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation-induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation
      determined by CFSE dilution. Decreased CD25 expression and intracellular
      IL-2 levels were correlated with this defect in cell proliferation. IL-2,
      IFN-gamma and IL-10 secretion were also reduced while IL-4 secretion was
      not altered. Increased phosphorylation of SOCS3 and dephosphorylation of
      STAT5 were induced by DEDTP after as little as 5min of exposure. In
      addition, DEDTP induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 and NFAT
      nuclear translocation. These results suggest that DEDTP can modulate
      phosphorylation of intracellular proteins such as SOCS3, which functions
      as a negative regulator of cytokine signalling, and that DEDTP exposure
      may thus cause T cells to fail to respond to further antigen challenges.

      regulatory T cells and inhibits effector T cells.
PG  - 1785-95
AB  - The Jak inhibitor CP-690,550 inhibits alloreactivity and is currently
      being investigated for prevention of allograft rejection after
      transplantation. In this study, we examined the effect of CP-690,550 on
      IL-2-mediated Jak/STAT5 phosphorylation by
      CD4(+)CD25(bright)FoxP3(+)CD127(-/low) T cells (Treg) and CD4(+)CD25(neg)
      effector T cells (Teff) in kidney transplant (KTx) patients.
      Phosphospecific flow cytometry was used to study the effect of CP-690,550
      on IL-2-induced intracellular STAT5-phosphorylation. IL-2-induced
      phosphorylation of STAT5 (P-STAT5) in both Treg and Teff, which was
      significantly higher for CD4(+)CD25(bright) Treg (increased by 71%, mean)
      than for CD4(+)CD25(neg) Teff (increased by 42%). In the presence of 100
      ng/mL CP-690,550, a clinically relevant exposure, IL-2-induced P-STAT5 was
      partially inhibited in CD4(+)CD25(bright)Treg (% inhibition; 51%), while
      almost completely blocked in Teff (%inhibition; 84%, p = 0.03). The IC(50)
      was 2-3 times higher for Treg (104 ng/mL) than for Teff (40 ng/mL, p =
      0.02). In the presence of CP-690,550, Treg exhibited additional
      suppressive activities on the alloactivated proliferation of Teff (56%,
      mean). In addition, CD4(+)CD25(bright) Treg from KTx-patients receiving
      CP-690,550 vigorously suppressed the proliferation of Teff (87%, mean).
      Our findings show that CP-690,550 effectively inhibits Teff function but
      preserves the suppressive activity of CD4(+)CD25(bright) regulatory T
      cells.

      delineate differences in signaling thresholds required for lymphocyte
      development and maintenance.
PG  - 1393-403
AB  - X-linked SCID patients are deficient in functional IL-2Rgamma(c) leading
      to the loss of IL-2/IL-4/IL-7/IL-9/IL-15/IL-21 signaling and a lack of NK
      and mature T cells. Patients treated with IL-2Rgamma(c) gene therapy have
      T cells develop; however, their NK cell numbers remain low, suggesting
      antiviral responses may be compromised. Similarly, IL-2Rgamma(c)(-/-) mice
      reconstituted with IL-2Rgamma(c) developed few NK cells, and reconstituted
      T cells exhibited defective proliferative responses suggesting incomplete
      recovery of IL-2Rgamma(c) signaling. Given the shift toward
      self-inactivating long terminal repeats with weaker promoters to control
      the risk of leukemia, we assessed NK and T cell numbers and function in
      IL-2Rgamma(c)(-/-) mice reconstituted with limiting amounts of
      IL-2Rgamma(c). Reconstitution resulted in lower IL-2/-15-mediated STAT5
      phosphorylation and proliferation in NK and T cells. However, TCR
      costimulation restored cytokine-driven T cell proliferation to wild-type
      levels. Vector modifications that improved IL-2Rgamma(c) levels increased
      cytokine-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in both populations and increased
      NK cell proliferation demonstrating that IL-2Rgamma(c) levels are
      limiting. In addition, although the half-lives of both NK and T cells
      expressing intermediate levels of IL-2Rgamma(c) are reduced compared with
      wild-type cells, the reduction in NK cell half-live is much more severe
      than in T cells. Collectively, these data indicate different IL-2Rgamma(c)
      signaling thresholds for lymphocyte development and proliferation making
      functional monitoring imperative during gene therapy. Further, our
      findings suggest that IL-2Rgamma(c) reconstituted T cells may persist more
      efficiently than NK cells due to compensation for suboptimal IL-2Rgamma(c)
      signaling by the TCR.

TI  - Selective expansion of chimeric antigen receptor-targeted T-cells with
      potent effector function using interleukin-4.
PG  - 25538-44
AB  - Polyclonal T-cells can be directed against cancer using transmembrane
      fusion molecules known as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Although
      preclinical studies have provided encouragement, pioneering clinical
      trials using CAR-based immunotherapy have been disappointing. Key
      obstacles are the need for robust expansion ex vivo followed by sustained
      survival of infused T-cells in patients. To address this, we have
      developed a system to achieve selective proliferation of CAR(+) T-cells
      using IL-4, a cytokine with several pathophysiologic and therapeutic links
      to cancer. A chimeric cytokine receptor (4alphabeta) was engineered by
      fusion of the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) ectodomain to the beta(c)
      subunit, used by IL-2 and IL-15. Addition of IL-4 to T-cells that express
      4alphabeta resulted in STAT3/STAT5/ERK phosphorylation and exponential
      proliferation, mimicking the actions of IL-2. Using receptor-selective
      IL-4 muteins, partnering of 4alphabeta with gamma(c) was implicated in
      signal delivery. Next, human T-cells were engineered to co-express
      4alphabeta with a CAR specific for tumor-associated MUC1. These T-cells
      exhibited an unprecedented capacity to elicit repeated destruction of
      MUC1-expressing tumor cultures and expanded through several logs in vitro.
      Despite prolonged culture in IL-4, T-cells retained specificity for target
      antigen, type 1 polarity, and cytokine dependence. Similar findings were
      observed using CARs directed against two additional tumor-associated
      targets, demonstrating generality of application. Furthermore, this system
      allows rapid ex vivo expansion and enrichment of engineered T-cells from
      small blood volumes, under GMP-compliant conditions. Together, these
      findings provide proof of principle for the development of IL-4-enhanced
      T-cell immunotherapy of cancer.

TI  - A physiological role for inducible FOXP3(+) Treg cells. Lessons from women
      with reproductive failure.
PG  - 432-41
AB  - We have previously shown a decreased frequency and function of Tregs in
      women suffering from recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA). In the current
      study, we first investigated the expression of FOXP3 after T-cell
      activation. We observed that expression of FOXP3 in activated PBMCs was
      already present above baseline before any cell division, indicating that
      it was induced in cells that were previously negative for this
      transcription factor. Because RSA women showed a more limited expansion of
      FOXP3-positive cells, we next assessed the role of IL-2 signaling through
      STAT5, which is known to be required for generation of inducible Tregs
      (iTregs). We demonstrated not only that TGF-beta and IL-2 were diminished
      but also that the IL-2-STAT-5 signaling axis was down regulated in RSA
      women. Finally, in addition to a limited FOXP3(+) cells expansion in
      vitro, iTregs from RSA women showed a strikingly lower suppressor
      activity.

TI  - Selective functional inhibition of JAK-3 is sufficient for efficacy in
      collagen-induced arthritis in mice.
PG  - 2283-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: All gamma-chain cytokines signal through JAK-3 and JAK-1 acting
      in tandem. We undertook this study to determine whether the JAK-3
      selective inhibitor WYE-151650 would be sufficient to disrupt cytokine
      signaling and to ameliorate autoimmune disease pathology without
      inhibiting other pathways mediated by JAK-1, JAK-2, and Tyk-2. METHODS:
      JAK-3 kinase selective compounds were characterized by kinase assay and
      JAK-3-dependent (interleukin-2 [IL-2]) and -independent (IL-6,
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) cell-based
      assays measuring proliferation or STAT phosphorylation. In vivo,
      off-target signaling was measured by IL-22- and erythropoietin
      (EPO)-mediated models, while on-target signaling was measured by
      IL-2-mediated signaling. Efficacy of JAK-3 inhibitors was determined using
      delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)
      models in mice. RESULTS: In vitro, WYE-151650 potently suppressed
      IL-2-induced STAT-5 phosphorylation and cell proliferation, while
      exhibiting 10-29-fold less activity against JAK-3-independent IL-6- or
      GM-CSF-induced STAT phosphorylation. Ex vivo, WYE-151650 suppressed
      IL-2-induced STAT phosphorylation, but not IL-6-induced STAT
      phosphorylation, as measured in whole blood. In vivo, WYE-151650 inhibited
      JAK-3-mediated IL-2-induced interferon-gamma production and decreased the
      natural killer cell population in mice, while not affecting IL-22-induced
      serum amyloid A production or EPO-induced reticulocytosis. WYE-151650 was
      efficacious in mouse DTH and CIA models. CONCLUSION: In vitro, ex vivo,
      and in vivo assays demonstrate that WYE-151650 is efficacious in mouse CIA
      despite JAK-3 selectivity. These data question the need to broadly inhibit
      JAK-1-, JAK-2-, or Tyk-2-dependent cytokine pathways for efficacy.

TI  - Ectodomain shedding of interleukin-2 receptor beta and generation of an
      intracellular functional fragment.
PG  - 22050-8
AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) regulates different functions of various lymphoid
      cell subsets. These are mediated by its binding to the IL-2 receptor
      (IL-2R) composed of three subunits (IL2-Ralpha, -beta, and -gamma(c)).
      IL-2Rbeta is responsible for the activation of several signaling pathways.
      Ectodomain shedding of membrane receptors is thought to be an important
      mechanism for down-regulation of cell surface receptor abundance but is
      also emerging as a mechanism that cell membrane-associated molecules
      require for proper action in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that IL-2Rbeta is
      cleaved in cell lines of different origin, including T cells, generating
      an intracellular 37-kDa fragment (37beta ic) that comprises the full
      intracellular C-terminal and transmembrane domains. Ectodomain shedding of
      IL-2Rbeta decreases in a mutant deleted of the juxtamembrane region, where
      cleavage is predicted to occur, and is inhibited by tissue inhibitor of
      metalloproteases-3. 37Beta ic is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates
      with STAT-5, a canonic signal transducer of IL-2R. Finally, lymphoid cell
      transfection with a truncated form of IL-2Rbeta mimicking 37beta ic
      increases their proliferation. These data indicate that IL-2Rbeta is
      subject to ectodomain shedding generating an intracellular fragment
      biologically functional, because (i) it is phosphorylated, (ii) it
      associates with STAT5A, and (iii) it increases cell proliferation.

TI  - High content cellular immune profiling reveals differences between rhesus
      monkeys and men.
PG  - 128-40
AB  - A better understanding of similarities and differences in the composition
      of the cellular immune system in non-human primates (NHPs) compared with
      human subjects will improve the interpretation of preclinical studies. It
      will also aid in addressing the usefulness of NHPs as subjects for
      studying chronic diseases, vaccine development and immune reconstitution.
      We employed high content colour flow cytometry and analysed simultaneously
      the expression of CD3, CD4, CD8alpha, CD8beta, CD16/CD56, CD45RA, CCR7,
      CD27, CD28, CD107a and the interleukin-7 receptor alpha-chain (IL-7Ralpha)
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 27 rhesus macaques and 16
      healthy human subjects. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were identified using
      anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD25, -FoxP3, and -IL-7Ralpha monoclonal antibodies.
      Responsiveness to IL-7 was gauged in a signal transducer and activation of
      transcription 5 (STAT-5) phosphorylation assay. Human and NHP PBMCs showed
      a similar T-cell composition pattern with some remarkable differences.
      Similarities: human and NHP CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells showed a similar
      STAT-5 phosphorylation pattern in response to IL-7. Multicolour flow
      cytometric analysis identified a CD4(+) CD8alphaalpha(+) CD8alphabeta(+)
      T-cell population in NHPs as well as in human subjects that expressed the
      degranulation marker CD107a and may represent a unique CD4(+) T-cell
      subset endowed with cytotoxic capacity. Differences: we identified in
      PBMCs from NHPs a higher proportion (5.16% in CD3(+) T cells) of
      CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells when compared with human donors (1.22% in CD3(+)
      T cells). NHP CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells produced tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha / interferon-gamma (TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma) or TNF-alpha,
      whereas human CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells produced simultaneously
      TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma and IL-2. A minor percentage of human CD8(+) T cells
      expressed CD25(bright) and FoxP3 (0.01%). In contrast, 0.07% of NHP CD8(+)
      T cells exhibited the CD25(bright) FoxP3(+) phenotype. PBMCs from NHPs
      showed less IL-7Ralpha-positive events in all T-cell subsets including
      CD4(+) Tregs (median 5%) as compared with human (median 12%). The data
      visualize commonalities and differences in immune cell subsets in humans
      and NHPs, most of them in long-lived memory cells and cells with
      suppressive functions. This provides a matrix to assess future efforts to
      study diseases and vaccines in NHPs.

TI  - Interleukin-4 downregulates CD127 expression and activity on human
      thymocytes and mature CD8+ T cells.
PG  - 1396-407
AB  - Signaling via the IL-7 receptor complex (IL-7Ralpha/CD127 and
      IL-2Rgamma/CD132) is required for T-cell development and survival.
      Decreased CD127 expression has been associated with persistent viral
      infections (e.g. HIV, HCV) and cancer. Many IL-2Rgamma-sharing (gammaC)
      cytokines decrease CD127 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice
      (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15) and in humans (IL-2, IL-7), suggesting a common
      function. IL-4 is of particular interest as it is upregulated in HIV
      infection and in thyroid and colon cancers. The role of IL-4 in regulating
      CD127 expression and IL-7 activity in human thymocytes and mature CD8+ T
      cells is unknown and was therefore investigated. IL-4 decreased CD127
      expression on all thymocyte subsets tested and only on naive (CD45RA+)
      CD8+ T cells, without altering membrane-bound CD127 mRNA expression.
      Pre-treatment of thymocytes or CD8+ T cells with IL-4 inhibited
      IL-7-mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 and decreased proliferation of CD8+
      T cells. By downregulating CD127 expression and signaling on developing
      thymocytes and CD8+ T cells, IL-4 is a potential contributor to impaired
      CD8+ T-cell function in some anti-viral and anti-tumor responses. These
      findings are of particular consequence to diseases such as HIV, HCV, RSV,
      measles and cancer, in which CD127 expression is decreased, IL-7 activity
      is impaired and IL-4 concentrations are elevated.

TI  - Zinc signals promote IL-2-dependent proliferation of T cells.
PG  - 1496-503
AB  - Zinc signals, i.e. a change of the intracellular concentration of free
      zinc ions in response to receptor stimulation, are involved in signal
      transduction in several immune cells. Here, the role of zinc signals in
      T-cell activation by IL-2 was investigated in the murine cytotoxic T-cell
      line CTLL-2 and in primary human T cells. Measurements with the
      fluorescent dyes FluoZin-3 and Zinquin showed that zinc is released from
      lysosomes into the cytosol in response to stimulation of the
      IL-2-receptor. Activation of the ERK-pathway was blocked by chelation of
      free zinc with N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-2(pyridyl-methyl)ethylenediamine,
      whereas zinc was not required for STAT5 phosphorylation. In addition, the
      key signaling molecules MEK and ERK were activated in response to elevated
      free intracellular zinc, induced by incubation with zinc and the ionophore
      pyrithione. Downstream of ERK activation, ERK-specific gene expression of
      c-fos and IL-2-induced proliferation was found to depend on zinc. Further
      experiments indicated that inhibition of MEK and ERK-dephosphorylating
      protein phosphatases is the molecular mechanism for the influence of zinc
      on this pathway. In conclusion, an increase of cytoplasmic free zinc is
      required for IL-2-induced ERK signaling and proliferation of T cells.

TI  - Expression of the autoimmune susceptibility gene FcRL3 on human regulatory
      T cells is associated with dysfunction and high levels of programmed cell
      death-1.
PG  - 3639-47
AB  - CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (T(reg)) play a critical role in
      maintaining self-tolerance and inhibiting autoimmune disease. Despite
      being a major focus of modern immunological investigation, many aspects of
      T(reg) biology remain unknown. In a screen for novel candidate genes
      involved in human T(reg) function, we detected the expression of an
      autoimmune susceptibility gene, FcRL3, in T(reg) but not in conventional
      CD4(+) T cells. FcRL3 is an orphan receptor of unknown function with
      structural homology to classical Fc receptors. Numerous genetic studies
      have demonstrated a link between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the
      FCRL3 promoter and both overexpression of FcRL3 and autoimmune diseases
      such as rheumatoid arthritis. Given the critical role of T(reg) in
      suppressing autoimmunity, we sought to ascertain how expression of FcRL3
      relates to the phenotype, differentiation, and function of T(reg). We show
      in this study that FcRL3 is expressed on a population of thymically
      derived T(reg) that exhibits a memory phenotype and high levels of
      programmed cell death-1. Purified FcRL3(+) T(reg) are less responsive to
      antigenic stimulation in the presence of IL-2 than their FcRL3(-)
      counterparts, despite intact proximal and distal IL-2 signaling as
      determined by phosphorylation of Stat-5 and upregulation of Bcl2. In vitro
      suppression assays demonstrated that FcRL3(+) T(reg) have reduced capacity
      to suppress the proliferation of effector T cells. These data suggest that
      FcRL3 expression is associated with T(reg) dysfunction that may, in turn,
      contribute to the loss of self-tolerance and the development of
      autoimmunity.

TI  - NSC114792, a novel small molecule identified through structure-based
      computational database screening, selectively inhibits JAK3.
PG  - 36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human or animals lacking either JAK3 or the common gamma chain
      (gammac) expression display severe combined immunodeficiency disease,
      indicating the crucial role of JAK3 in T-cell development and the
      homeostasis of the immune system. JAK3 has also been suggested to
      contribute to the pathogenesis of tumorigenesis. Recent studies identified
      activating JAK3 mutations in patients with various hematopoietic
      malignancies, including acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Importantly,
      functional analyses of some of those JAK3 mutations have been shown to
      cause lethal hematopoietic malignancies in animal models. These
      observations make JAK3 an ideal therapeutic target for the treatment of
      various human diseases. To identify novel small molecule inhibitors of
      JAK3, we performed structure-based virtual screen using the 3D structure
      of JAK3 kinase domain and the NCI diversity set of compounds. RESULTS: We
      identified NSC114792 as a lead compound. This compound directly blocked
      the catalytic activity of JAK3 but not that of other JAK family members in
      vitro. In addition, treatment of 32D/IL-2Rbeta cells with the compound led
      to a block in IL-2-dependent activation of JAK3/STAT5 but not
      IL-3-dependent activation of JAK2/STAT5. Consistent with the specificity
      of NSC114792 for JAK3, it selectively inhibited persistently-activated
      JAK3, but failed to affect the activity of other JAK family members and
      other oncogenic kinases in various cancer cell lines. Finally, we showed
      that NSC114792 decreases cell viability by inducing apoptosis through
      down-regulating anti-apoptotic gene expression only in cancer cells
      harboring persistently-active JAK3. CONCLUSIONS: NSC114792 is a lead
      compound that selectively inhibits JAK3 activity. Therefore, our study
      suggests that this small molecule inhibitor of JAK3 can be used as a
      starting point to develop a new class of drugs targeting JAK3 activity,
      and may have therapeutic potential in various diseases that are caused by
      aberrant JAK3 activity.

TI  - [Long-term therapeutic effect of Zenapax after renal transplantation]
PG  - 2565-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was any lingering effect after
      discontinuing Zenapax in renal transplantation and investigate there was
      any alternative immunity-regulating pathway of Zenapax other than
      IL-2/IL-2R. METHODS: Thirty patients of renal transplantation were divided
      into 2 groups. One group of 15 received 2 dosages of induction therapy of
      Zenapax and another 15 regular immunosuppressive therapy. IL-2, IL-10,
      STAT5 and CD40L were tested followed up at 2 hours pre-transplantation, 1,
      3 and 6 months post-transplantation. RESULTS: The levels of IL-2 and STAT
      had no difference between the induction group and the control group. The
      level of IL-10 of induction group (59.4 +/- 7.7) ng/L was obviously higher
      than control group (36.8 +/- 8.4) ng/L at 3 months post-transplantation.
      CD40L level of induction group (10.6 +/- 3.6) was lower than control group
      (35.6 +/- 8.4) at 1 month post-transplantation. CONCLUSION: Zenapax can
      reduce B-cell-mediated humoral immunity at 1 month post-transplantation
      through CD40L pathway.

TI  - Transient CD86 expression on hepatitis C virus-specific CD8+ T cells in
      acute infection is linked to sufficient IL-2 signaling.
PG  - 2410-22
AB  - Costimulatory signals via B7/CD28 family molecules (signal 2) are critical
      for effective adaptive CD8(+) T cell immune responses. In addition to
      costimulatory signals, B7/CD28 family coinhibitory receptor/ligands that
      modulate immune responses have been identified. In acute hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection, programmed death receptor 1, an inhibitory receptor in
      the CD28 family, is highly expressed on virus-specific CD8(+) T cells, yet
      vigorous immune responses often develop. We hypothesized that other
      costimulatory signals present during the acute phase of HCV infection
      would be important to counter this negative signaling. In this study, we
      found that CD86 was highly expressed on HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells early
      in acute HCV infection and was lost on transition to chronic HCV
      infection; the expression of CD86 was different from other activation
      markers, because expression was delayed after in vitro TCR stimulation and
      required sufficient IL-2 signaling; and HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells in the
      liver of patients with chronic HCV infection were highly activated (CD69,
      CD38, and HLA-DR expression), but only a minority expressed CD86 or showed
      evidence of recent IL-2 signaling (low basal phosphorylated STAT5),
      despite persistent viremia. Our study identified B7 ligand expression on
      HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells as a distinct marker of effective T cell
      stimulation with IL-2 signaling in acute HCV infection. Expression of
      costimulatory molecules, such as CD86, early in HCV infection may be
      essential in overcoming inhibitory signals from the high level of
      programmed death receptor 1 expression also seen at this phase of
      infection.

TI  - Interleukin-2 and inflammation induce distinct transcriptional programs
      that promote the differentiation of effector cytolytic T cells.
PG  - 79-90
AB  - Interleukin(IL)-2 and inflammation regulate effector and memory cytolytic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) generation during infection. We demonstrate a complex
      interplay between IL-2 and inflammatory signals during CTL
      differentiation. IL-2 stimulation induced the transcription factor
      eomesodermin (Eomes), upregulated perforin (Prf1) transcription, and
      repressed re-expression of memory CTL markers Bcl6 and IL-7Ralpha. Binding
      of Eomes and STAT5 to Prf1 cis-regulatory regions correlated with
      transcriptional initiation (increased recruitment of RNA polymerase II to
      the Prf1 promoter). Inflammation (CpG, IL-12) enhanced expression of
      IL-2Ralpha and the transcription factor T-bet, but countered late Eomes
      and perforin induction while preventing IL-7Ralpha repression by IL-2.
      After infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,
      IL-2Ralpha-deficient effector CD8(+) T cells expressed more Bcl6 but less
      perforin and granzyme B, formed fewer KLRG-1(+) and T-bet-expressing CTL,
      and killed poorly. Thus, inflammation influences both effector and memory
      CTL differentiation, whereas persistent IL-2 stimulation promotes effector
      at the expense of memory CTL development.

TI  - Pharmacologic inhibition of MEK-ERK signaling enhances Th17
      differentiation.
PG  - 1849-57
AB  - The cytokines and transcription factors that promote Th17 cell development
      have been extensively studied. However, the signaling pathways that
      antagonize Th17 differentiation remain poorly characterized. In this
      study, we report that pharmacologic inhibition of MEK-ERK signaling
      enhances the in vitro differentiation of Th17 cells and increases their
      gene expression of il-17a, il-17f, il-21, il-22, and il-23r. IL-2, which
      suppresses Th17 differentiation via STAT5 activation, also acts through
      ERK signaling to inhibit Th17 generation. In turn, ERK signaling is found
      to potentiate the production of IL-2 and activate STAT5, suggesting the
      existence of an autoregulatory loop to constrain Th17 development.
      Finally, compared with the transfer of untreated Th17 cells, the transfer
      of ERK-inhibited Th17 cells leads to accelerated onset and exacerbated
      colitis in immunodeficient mice. Our data indicate that MEK-ERK signaling
      negatively regulates Th17 differentiation in a Th cell-intrinsic manner.

TI  - Protein phosphatase 2A regulates interleukin-2 receptor complex formation
      and JAK3/STAT5 activation.
PG  - 3582-91
AB  - Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a key role in interleukin-2
      (IL-2) receptor-mediated activation of Janus tyrosine kinase 3 (JAK3) and
      signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in lymphocytes.
      Although the mechanisms governing IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation
      and activation of JAK3/STAT5 have been extensively studied, the role of
      serine/threonine phosphorylation in controlling these effectors remains to
      be elucidated. Using phosphoamino acid analysis, JAK3 and STAT5 were
      determined to be serine and tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-2
      stimulation of the human natural killer-like cell line, YT. IL-2
      stimulation also induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta,
      but not IL-2Rgamma. To investigate the regulation of serine/threonine
      phosphorylation in IL-2 signaling, the roles of protein phosphatase 1
      (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) were examined. Inhibition of phosphatase activity by
      calyculin A treatment of YT cells resulted in a significant induction of
      serine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT5, and serine/threonine
      phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta. Moreover, inhibition of PP2A, but not PP1,
      diminished IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta, JAK3, and
      STAT5, and abolished STAT5 DNA binding activity. Serine/threonine
      phosphorylation of IL-2Rbeta by a staurosporine-sensitive kinase also
      blocked its association with JAK3 and IL-2Rgamma in YT cells. Taken
      together, these data indicate that serine/threonine phosphorylation
      negatively regulates IL-2 signaling at multiple levels, including receptor
      complex formation and JAK3/STAT5 activation, and that this regulation is
      counteracted by PP2A. These findings also suggest that PP2A may serve as a
      therapeutic target for modulating JAK3/STAT5 activation in human disease.

TI  - The human ortholog of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and
      interleukin-2 fusion protein induces potent ex vivo natural killer cell
      activation and maturation.
PG  - 9020-8
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are appealing cellular pharmaceuticals for
      cancer therapy because of their innate ability to recognize and kill tumor
      cells. Therefore, the development of methods that can enhance the potency
      in their anticancer effect would be desirable. We have previously shown
      that a murine granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF)/interleukin 2 (IL-2) fusion protein displays novel antitumor
      properties in vivo compared with both cytokines in combination due to
      recruitment of NK cells. In the present work, we have found that human
      ortholog of the GM-CSF/IL-2 fusion protein (a.k.a. hGIFT2) induces robust
      NK cell activation ex vivo with significant secretion of RANTES and a
      37-fold increase in IFNgamma production when compared with either IL-2 or
      GM-CSF single cytokine treatment or their combination. Moreover, hGIFT2
      upregulates the expression of NK cell activating receptors NKp44, NKp46,
      and DNAM-1 (CD226), as well as CD69, CD107a, and IL-2Rbeta expression. In
      addition, hGIFT2 promotes NK cell maturation, based on the downregulation
      of CD117 expression and upregulation of CD11b. This phenotype correlates
      with significantly greater cytotoxicity against tumor cells. At the
      molecular level, hGIFT2 leads to a potent activation of Janus-activated
      kinases (JAK) downstream of both IL-2 and GM-CSF receptors (JAK1 and JAK2,
      respectively) and consequently leads to a hyperphosphorylation of signal
      transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3, and STAT5. In
      conclusion, hGIFT2 fusokine possesses unique biochemical properties
      distinct from IL-2 and GM-CSF, constitutes a novel and potent tool for ex
      vivo NK cell activation and maturation, and may be of use for cancer cell
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Impaired IL-7 signaling may explain a case of atypical JAK3-SCID.
PG  - 221-8
AB  - Janus kinase 3-severe combined immunodeficiency (JAK3-SCID) is an
      autosomal recessive immunodeficiency disease caused by various mutations
      in the JAK3 gene. Typical JAK3-SCID is characterized by a phenotype in
      which B cells are present but T and NK cells are not, the T(-)B(+)NK(-)
      phenotype, and by impaired signaling through cytokine receptors that use
      the common gamma chain (gammac) subunit. An atypical JAK3-SCID case
      carrying a single glutamate to glycine substitution mutation (E481G) in
      the JH3 domain of one JAK3 allele, and a deletion mutation (del482-596) in
      the JH3 and JH2 domains of the other allele was reported previously.
      Although this patient had CD4(+) T cells and NK cells unlike typical
      cases, the CD4(+) T cells were functionally impaired. We report here that
      the JAK3-E481G mutant transduced IL-2-, IL-4-, IL-15-, and IL-21-induced
      signals as efficiently as wild-type JAK3. However, this mutant failed to
      respond to IL-7 by phosphorylating JAK1, JAK3, or STAT5. The other mutant
      JAK3, JAK3-del482-596, was non-functional. Thus, an impaired IL-7 signal
      may cause SCID and compromise T-cell differentiation, even if the IL-15
      signal is preserved and supports NK-cell development, as in this patient.

TI  - Knocking off the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS): their roles in
      mammalian pregnancy.
PG  - 117-23
AB  - This review discusses the possible role of the suppressor of cytokine
      signaling (SOCS) proteins in mammalian reproduction. SOCS are regulatory
      proteins that are rapidly transcribed in response to intracellular Janus
      kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT)
      signaling, a cascade governing biological functions including
      cytokine-induced immunological responses and reproductive processes. For
      instance STAT3 appears to mediate trophoblast invasion induced by LIF. The
      SOCS family includes 8 members (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein [CIS] and
      SOCS1-7) that orchestrate distinct reactions by antagonizing STAT
      activation. Emerging evidence points to a role of some family members in
      synchronizing Th1/Th2 cell profiles, the balance in which is considered
      vital to pregnancy maintenance. The reproductive phenotypes of mutant mice
      harboring targeted disruption of SOCS gene isoforms offer insights for
      reproductive immunology, trophoblast function and human pregnancy. CIS
      transgenic mice display impaired responses to IL-2 and resemble STAT5
      deficient mice, except they are fertile. SOCS1 deficiency leads to an
      overabundance of IFNgamma signaling, yet SOCS1 null mutant mice are able
      to reproduce. Lack of SOCS3 is embryonically lethal due to placental
      insufficiency, while SOCS3 over-expression leads to elevated Th2
      responses. SOCS3 seems to be vital for reproduction by regulating
      LIF-driven trophoblast differentiation. SOCS5 inhibits IL-4 signaling, yet
      the SOCS5 transgenic mouse has no conspicuous reproductive phenotype.
      SOCS-6 and SOCS-7 null mutant mice display growth retardation. In summary,
      SOCS proteins are avidly involved in fine regulation of immunological and
      other vital cellular responses. Many of the above phenotypes present
      contradictions to accepted reproductive immunological paradigms.

TI  - Engineered interleukin-2 antagonists for the inhibition of regulatory T
      cells.
PG  - 887-94
AB  - The immunosuppressive effects of CD4+ CD25 high regulatory T cells (Tregs)
      interfere with antitumor immune responses in cancer patients. Here, we
      present a novel class of engineered human interleukin (IL)-2 analogs that
      antagonizes the IL-2 receptor, for inhibiting regulatory T cell
      suppression. These antagonists have been engineered for high affinity to
      the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor and very low affinity to either the
      beta or gamma subunit, resulting in a signaling-deficient IL-2 analog that
      sequesters the IL-2 receptor alpha subunit from wild type IL-2. Two
      variants, "V91R" and "Q126T" with residue substitutions that disrupt the
      beta and gamma subunit binding interfaces, respectively, have been
      characterized in both a T cell line and in human primary Tregs. These
      mutants retain their high affinity binding to IL-2 receptor alpha subunit,
      but do not activate STAT5 phosphorylation or stimulate T cell growth. The
      2 mutants competitively antagonize wild-type IL-2 signaling through the
      IL-2 receptor with similar efficacy, with inhibition constants of 183 pM
      for V91R and 216 pM for Q126T. Here, we present a novel approach to
      CD25-mediated Treg inhibition, with the use of an engineered human IL-2
      analog that antagonizes the IL-2 receptor.

TI  - Cell contact interaction between adipose-derived stromal cells and
      allo-activated T lymphocytes.
PG  - 3436-46
AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells regulate immune cell function via the secretion
      of soluble factors. Cell membrane interactions between these cell types
      may play an additional role. Here, we demonstrate that subpopulations of
      allo-activated T cells are capable of binding to human adipose-derived
      stromal cells (ASC). The bound T-cell population contained CD8+ T cells
      and was enriched for CD4-CD8- T cells, whereas the proportion of CD4+ T
      cells was decreased compared with the non-bound T-cell population. Bound
      CD4+ T cells had high proliferative activity and increased CD25 and FoxP3
      expression. However, they also expressed CD127, excluding regulatory
      T-cell function. In CD8+ T cells, IL-2 sensitivity, as determined by the
      analysis of phosphorylated STAT5, was lower in the presence of ASC and
      even lower in bound cells. In contrast, IL-2-induced phosphorylated STAT5
      levels were higher in bound CD4+ T cells than in non-bound CD4+ T cells.
      Additionally, pro-proliferative TGF-beta signalling via endoglin and
      SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation was detected in bound CD4+ T cells. Even after
      prolonged co-culture with ASC, the activated phenotype of bound CD4+ T
      cells persisted. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the binding
      of lymphocytes to ASC represents an immunomodulatory mechanism in which
      CD8+ T cells are inhibited in their responsiveness to pro-inflammatory
      stimuli and reactive CD4+ T cells are depleted from the immune response.

TI  - Disengaging the IL-2 receptor with daclizumab enhances IL-7-mediated
      proliferation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.
PG  - 2727-35
AB  - Allograft rejection is mainly driven by the production of IL-2, which
      expands T cells by linking the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) composed of three
      subunits: CD25, CD122 and CD132. Daclizumab, widely used in
      immunosuppression, is a humanized anti-CD25 antibody that disrupts IL-2
      signaling by binding to CD25 and preventing the assembly of the
      high-affinity IL-2R. Here we show that Daclizumab, while blocking the
      T-cell response to IL-2, increases CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell proliferative
      response to the homeostatic cytokine IL-7. The IL-7R shares CD132 with the
      IL-2R and blocking of CD25 by Daclizumab results in the enhanced formation
      of the IL-7R that in turn allows IL-7 to bind more efficiently on the cell
      surface. The consequently increased IL-7R signaling boosts intracellular
      phosphorylated STAT5 and T-cell proliferation. In addition, treatment with
      Daclizumab delays the internalization of CD127 upon IL-7 treatment,
      retaining T-cell sensitivity to IL-7 for a prolonged time. This effect of
      Daclizumab highlights the redundancy of the cytokine system, which may
      influence T-cell proliferation in transplanted patients, and provides
      information to improve future immunosuppressive strategies.

TI  - Novel role for interleukin-2 receptor-Jak signaling in retrovirus
      transmission.
PG  - 11467-76
AB  - Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of
      adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and it encodes a number of nonstructural
      proteins that are involved in virus replication and immune evasion. The
      viral protein p12 previously has been characterized to interfere with
      major histocompatibility complex class, ICAM-1, and ICAM-2 expression, and
      it activates STAT5. Using a previously established T-cell line
      immortalized with an HTLV-1 molecular clone deleted for p12, we assessed
      the role of p12 in regulating cellular growth and virus transmission.
      These cells were complemented for p12 expression by the transduction of a
      lentivirus vector expressing p12. We report that p12 conferred a selective
      growth advantage in vitro and increased the colony formation of human T
      cells in soft-agar assays. Consistently with previous studies, p12- and
      p12+ cell lines produced similar amounts of virus particles released into
      the supernatant of cultured cells, although we found that p12 expression
      greatly enhanced virus transmission. Moreover, we found that interleukin-2
      (IL-2) stimulation also increased HTLV-1 transmission whether p12 was
      expressed or not, and inversely, that the inhibition of Jak signaling
      significantly reduced HTLV-1 transmission. Intriguingly, IL-2/Jak
      signaling was not associated with changes in viral gene expression, viral
      RNA encapsidation, the maturation of the virus particle, cell-cell
      adherence, or Gag polarization and virological synapse formation. We do
      demonstrate, however, that IL-2 stimulation and p12 expression
      significantly increased the rate of syncytium formation, revealing a novel
      role for IL-2 signaling and Jak activation in HTLV-1 virus transmission.

TI  - Novel human interleukin-15 agonists.
PG  - 3598-607
AB  - IL-15 is an immunostimulatory cytokine trans-presented with the IL-15
      receptor alpha-chain to the shared IL-2/IL-15Rbeta and common gamma-chains
      displayed on the surface of T cells and NK cells. To further define the
      functionally important regions of this cytokine, activity and binding
      studies were conducted on human IL-15 muteins generated by site-directed
      mutagenesis. Amino acid substitutions of the asparagine residue at
      position 72, which is located at the end of helix C, were found to provide
      both partial agonist and superagonist activity, with various
      nonconservative substitutions providing enhanced activity. Particularly,
      the N72D substitution provided a 4-5-fold increase in biological activity
      of the IL-15 mutein compared with the native molecule based on
      proliferation assays with cells bearing human IL-15Rbeta and common
      gamma-chains. The IL-15N72D mutein exhibited superagonist activity through
      improved binding ability to the human IL-15Rbeta-chain. However, the
      enhanced potency of IL-15N72D was not observed with cells expressing the
      mouse IL-15Ralpha-IL-15Rbeta-gamma(c) complex, suggesting that this effect
      is specific to the human IL-15 receptor. The enhanced biological activity
      of IL-15N72D was associated with more intense phosphorylation of Jak1 and
      Stat5 and better anti-apoptotic activity compared with the wild-type
      IL-15. IL-15N72D superagonist activity was also preserved when linked to a
      single-chain TCR domain to generate a tumor-specific fusion protein. Thus,
      the human IL-15 superagonist muteins and fusions may create opportunities
      to construct more efficacious immunotherapeutic agents with clinical
      utility.

TI  - STAT5 regulation of BCL10 parallels constitutive NFkappaB activation in
      lymphoid tumor cells.
PG  - 67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 A and B
      (STAT5) are key survival factors in cells of the lymphoid lineage.
      Identification of novel, tissue-specific STAT5 regulated genes would
      advance the ability to combat diseases due to aberrant STAT5 signaling. In
      the present work a library of human STAT5 bound genomic elements was
      created and validated. RESULTS: Of several STAT5 responsive genomic
      regulatory elements identified, one was located within the first intron of
      the human BCL10 gene. Chromatin immuno-precipitation reactions confirmed
      constitutive in vivo STAT5 binding to this intronic fragment in various
      human lymphoid tumor cell lines. Interestingly, non-phosphorylated STAT5
      was found in the nuclei of Kit225 and YT cells in the absence of cytokine
      stimulation that paralleled constitutive NFkappaB activation. Inhibition
      of the hyperactive JAK3/STAT5 pathway in MT-2 cells via the Mannich-base,
      NC1153, diminished the constitutive in vivo occupancy of BCL10-SBR by
      STAT5, reduced NFkappaB activity and BCL10 protein expression in a dose
      dependent manner. Moreover, depletion of STAT5 via selective antisense
      oligonucleotide treatment similarly resulted in decreased BCL10 mRNA and
      protein expression, cellular viability and impaired NFkappaB activity
      independent of IL-2. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the NFkappaB
      regulator BCL10 is an IL-2-independent STAT5 target gene. These findings
      proffer a model in which un-activated STAT5 can regulate pathways critical
      for lymphoid cell survival and inhibitors that disrupt STAT5 function
      independent of tyrosine phosphorylation may be therapeutically effective
      in treating certain leukemias/lymphomas.

TI  - The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist FTY720 potently inhibits
      regulatory T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 3751-60
AB  - CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cell (Treg) entry into secondary lymphoid
      organs and local expansion is critical for their immunosuppressive
      function. Long-term application of the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor
      agonist FTY720 exerts pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects, whereas
      short-term FTY720 boosts antiviral immunity. In this study, we provide
      evidence that FTY720 potently inhibits Treg proliferation in vitro and in
      vivo without affecting their viability, phenotype, or in vitro
      immunosuppression. In contrast, adoptively transferred Treg exposed ex
      vivo to FTY720 lost their protective effects in murine models of acute
      glomerulonephritis and acute graft-vs-host disease. On a cellular level,
      FTY720 inhibits IL-2-induced STAT-5 phosphorylation, paralleled by a loss
      of FoxP3 expression during Treg expansion in vitro. Notably, loss of in
      vivo immunosuppression is not due to impaired migration to or localization
      within secondary lymphoid organs. We could even show a selective trapping
      of adoptively transferred Treg in inflammatory lymph nodes by FTY720.
      Finally, Treg isolated from animals systemically exposed to FTY720 also
      exhibit a significantly impaired proliferative response upon restimulation
      when compared with Treg isolated from solvent-treated animals. In summary,
      our data suggest that sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor-mediated signals
      induced by FTY720 abrogate their in vivo immunosuppressive potential by
      blocking IL-2 induced expansion, which is indispensable for their in vivo
      immunosuppressive activity.

TI  - Self-peptides prolong survival in murine autoimmunity via reduced
      IL-2/IL-7-mediated STAT5 signaling, CD8 coreceptor, and V alpha 2
      down-regulation.
PG  - 3130-8
AB  - Although the pathogenic role of B cells and CD4 T cells has been studied
      extensively, less is known about the role of CD8 T cells in autoimmunity
      and self-tolerance. To evaluate the role of CD8 T cells in autoimmunity
      and its modulation using self-peptides, we used mice expressing soluble
      OVA (sOVA) under control of the keratin-14 promoter. Spontaneous
      autoimmunity occurred when sOVA mice were crossed with OT-I mice, whose
      CD8 T cells carry a Valpha2/Vbeta5-transgenic TCR with specificity for the
      OVA(257-264) peptide. Eighty-three percent of OVA/OT-I mice died during
      the first 2 wk of life due to multiple organ inflammation. In contrast,
      preventive or therapeutic OVA(257-264) peptide injections induced a
      dose-dependent increase in survival. Healthy survivors exhibited
      reductions in peripheral CD8 T cells, CD8 coreceptor, and Valpha2
      expression. Furthermore, CD8 T cells from healthy mice were anergic and
      could not be activated by exogenous IL-2. A block in IL-2/IL-7 signaling
      via the STAT5 pathway provided the basis for low surface expression of the
      CD8 coreceptor and failure of IL-2 to break CD8 T cell anergy. Thus, the
      soluble TCR ligand triggered multiple tolerance mechanisms in these
      sOVA/OT-I mice, making this treatment approach a potential paradigm for
      modulating human autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 limits the development
      of adaptive regulatory T cells.
PG  - 587-95
AB  - T-cell responses to a cytokine milieu instruct the development of multiple
      effector phenotypes. While transforming growth factor-beta(1)
      (TGF-beta(1)) inhibits the development of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2
      cells, we demonstrate that like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-4, IL-12 can
      inhibit the development of TGF-beta(1)-induced Foxp3-expressing adaptive T
      regulatory (aTreg) cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription
      4 (STAT4) is critical for the response to IL-12, although there is a
      parallel pathway involving T box expressed in T cells (T-bet), and cells
      from mice double-deficient in STAT4 and T-bet are refractory to the
      inhibition of aTreg-cell development by IL-12. While the ability of these
      cytokines to promote Th differentiation may contribute to this effect, we
      observe that culture with IL-12, or other instructive cytokines, results
      in an increase in repressive chromatin modifications at the Foxp3 locus
      that limit STAT5 binding to Foxp3, without observed effects on IL-2
      signalling pathways. In a model of allergic lung inflammation there are
      increased percentages of Treg cells in the lungs of Stat4(-/-) mice,
      compared with wild-type mice, and increases in Treg cells correlate with
      decreased allergic inflammation. Overall, these results suggest an
      important role for STAT4 in regulating Treg-cell development.

TI  - JAK3 inhibition significantly attenuates psoriasiform skin inflammation in
      CD18 mutant PL/J mice.
PG  - 2183-92
AB  - JAK3, a member of the Janus kinase family, is predominantly expressed in
      hemopoietic cells and binds specifically to the common gamma chain of a
      subfamily of cytokine receptors that includes IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9,
      IL-15, and IL-21. Previous studies suggest that this tyrosine kinase plays
      key roles in mediating T cell functions, and inhibition of JAK3 has been
      shown to prevent graft rejection and decrease the severity of arthritis in
      rodent models. However, the functions of JAK3 in the development of skin
      immune responses and diseases such as psoriasis have not been determined.
      CD18 mutant PL/J mice develop spontaneous T cell-dependent psoriasiform
      skin disease with several similarities to human psoriasis. In this study,
      we treated mice with established skin disease with R348, a small molecule
      inhibitor of JAK3, and observed a marked attenuation of skin lesions
      following 6 wk of treatment. Histological analyses revealed major
      reductions of both epidermal and dermal lesion severity scores in
      R348-treated CD18-deficient PL/J mice compared with vehicle controls,
      which was associated with decreased CD4(+) T cell infiltration. In
      addition, systemic levels of IL-17, IL-22, IL-23, and TNF-alpha were
      significantly lower in mice receiving the compound, and T cells isolated
      from R348-treated mice also showed reduced phosphorylation of Stat5 after
      stimulation with IL-2. These findings suggest that small-molecule
      inhibitors of JAK3 may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory skin
      diseases such as psoriasis and strongly implicate JAK signaling events as
      important in the pathogenesis of this disease.

TI  - Inverse association of repressor growth factor independent-1 with CD8 T
      cell interleukin (IL)-7 receptor [alpha] expression and limited signal
      transducers and activators of transcription signaling in response to IL-7
      among [gamma]-chain cytokines in HIV patients.
PG  - 1341-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: CD8 T lymphocytes from chronically infected HIV-positive
      patients degenerate into a preapoptotic state and exhibit impaired
      functionality. Particularly in viremic patients, this was associated with
      an increased proportion of interleukin-7 receptor-alpha low-expressing
      (IL-7Ralpha(low)) effector-like CD8 T cells. As cytokine signaling through
      signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) is essential for
      cellular function, we hypothesized that activation of this pathway may be
      impaired in these cells. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cytokine-induced STAT
      activation in IL-7Ralpha(low) and IL-7Ralpha(high) CD8 T cells from
      chronically infected HIV-positive patients and investigate the potential
      molecular mechanism involved in the reduced IL-7Ralpha expression.
      METHODS: CD8 T cells from HIV-positive patients on and off antiretroviral
      therapy were assayed respectively for STAT activation, cytokine receptor,
      and transcription factor expression by flow cytometry and real-time PCR.
      RESULTS: IL-7 stimulation failed to activate STAT5 in a substantial
      proportion of patient CD8 T cells. This correlated with reduced IL-7Ralpha
      mRNA and surface protein expression. Interestingly, IL-7Ralpha(low) cells
      appeared to be fully capable of recruiting the STAT pathway in response to
      IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-15. mRNA expression suggested a potential role
      for growth factor independent (Gfi)-1 as an IL-7Ralpha transcriptional
      repressor, but not that of other transcriptional regulators studied,
      including Gfi-1B and GA-binding protein alpha. Programmed death-1
      inhibitory receptor, though upregulated in CD8 T cells from HIV-positive
      patients, appeared unrelated to IL-7Ralpha expression and STAT signaling
      capacity.

TI  - Differential responses of human regulatory T cells (Treg) and effector T
      cells to rapamycin.
PG  - e5994
AB  - BACKGROUND: The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (RAPA) promotes the
      expansion of CD4(+) CD25(high)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells via mechanisms
      that remain unknown. Here, we studied expansion, IL-2R-gamma chain
      signaling, survival pathways and resistance to apoptosis in human Treg
      responding to RAPA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CD4(+)CD25(+) and
      CD4(+)CD25(neg) T cells were isolated from PBMC of normal controls (n =
      21) using AutoMACS. These T cell subsets were cultured in the presence of
      anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and 1000 IU/mL IL-2 for 3 to 6 weeks. RAPA (1-100
      nM) was added to half of the cultures. After harvest, the cell phenotype,
      signaling via the PI3K/mTOR and STAT pathways, expression of survival
      proteins and Annexin V binding were determined and compared to values
      obtained with freshly-separated CD4(+)CD25(high) and CD4(+)CD25(neg) T
      cells. Suppressor function was tested in co-cultures with autologous
      CFSE-labeled CD4(+)CD25(neg) or CD8(+)CD25(neg) T-cell responders. The
      frequency and suppressor activity of Treg were increased after culture of
      CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in the presence of 1-100 nM RAPA (p<0.001).
      RAPA-expanded Treg were largely CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) cells and were
      resistant to apoptosis, while CD4(+)CD25(neg) T cells were sensitive. Only
      Treg upregulated anti-apoptotic and down-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins.
      Treg expressed higher levels of the PTEN protein than CD4(+)CD25(neg)
      cells. Activated Treg+/-RAPA preferentially phosphorylated STAT5 and STAT3
      and did not utilize the PI3K/mTOR pathway. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: RAPA
      favors Treg expansion and survival by differentially regulating signaling,
      proliferation and sensitivity to apoptosis of human effector T cells and
      Treg after TCR/IL-2 activation.

TI  - The initial phase of an immune response functions to activate regulatory T
      cells.
PG  - 332-9
AB  - An early reaction of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to Ag is the production of
      cytokines, notably IL-2. To detect cytokine-dependent responses, naive
      Ag-specific T cells were stimulated in vivo and the presence of
      phosphorylated STAT5 molecules was used to identify the cell populations
      responding to IL-2. Within hours of T cell priming, IL-2-dependent STAT5
      phosphorylation occurred primarily in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. In
      contrast, the Ag-specific T cells received STAT5 signals only after
      repeated Ag exposure or memory differentiation. Regulatory T cells
      receiving IL-2 signals proliferated and developed enhanced suppressive
      activity. These results indicate that one of the earliest events in a T
      cell response is the activation of endogenous regulatory cells,
      potentially to prevent autoimmunity.

TI  - Rainbow trout interleukin-2: cloning, expression and bioactivity analysis.
PG  - 414-22
AB  - In this study the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      cDNA has been cloned, and its expression and bioactivity analysed in head
      kidney leucocytes. The IL-2 precursor encoded an open reading frame of 429
      bp, that translates into a predicted protein of 142 aa, with a 20 aa
      signal peptide. The trout IL-2 had moderate protein homology (30.9%
      identity/48.3% similarity) with Fugu IL-2, the only IL-2 homologue
      identified in fish to date, with lower homology to avian (17.8%
      identity/23.2% similarity) and mammalian (34.2 identity/46.5% similarity)
      IL-2s. IL-2 expression was induced by the T cell mitogen PHA and by the
      mixed leucocyte reaction, where leucocytes from pairs of fish were
      cultured together for four days. Expression was also induced in vivo
      during bacterial (Yersinia ruckeri) infection. The Escherichia coli
      produced recombinant IL-2 was shown to increase the expression of two
      transcription factors, STAT5 and Blimp-1, known to be involved in IL-2
      signalling in mammals, as well as IFN-gamma, gIP and IL-2 itself. The
      potential signalling pathways involved and possible use as an adjuvant for
      fish vaccines are discussed.

TI  - Impaired STAT phosphorylation in T cells from melanoma patients in
      response to IL-2: association with clinical stage.
PG  - 4085-94
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the extent of signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) activation in response to interleukin 2 (IL-2) in
      melanoma patients' T cells, along with clinical stage of tumor
      progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: T lymphocytes from peripheral blood of
      healthy donors and of American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to IV
      melanoma patients, as well as from metastatic lymph nodes of patients,
      were evaluated for responsiveness to IL-2. CFSE assays and single-cell
      phospho-STAT-specific flow cytometry screening were used. Results. T cells
      from advanced melanoma patients, in comparison with healthy donors, showed
      reduced proliferation to IL-2 and IL-15, but not to anti-CD3 monoclonal
      antibody. Impaired response occurred in CCR7(+) and CCR7(-) T-cell
      subsets, but not in CD3(-) CD8(+) natural killer (NK) cells, and was not
      explained by induction of apoptosis, increased cytokine consumption, or
      altered IL-2R subunit expression in patients' T lymphocytes. By
      phospho-specific flow cytometry, defective STAT1 and STAT5 activation in
      response to IL-2 was found mainly in T lymphocytes from peripheral blood
      and/or tumor site of American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III and IV
      patients, compared with stage I and II patients and to donors, and in
      melanoma antigen-specific T cells isolated from metastatic lymph nodes. At
      tumor site, impaired STAT activation in T cells did not correlate with
      frequency of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells. Serum from advanced melanoma
      patients inhibited IL-2-dependent STAT activation in donors' T cells and a
      neutralizing monoclonal antibody to transforming growth factor beta1
      counteracted such inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence
      for development of impaired STAT signaling in response to IL-2, along with
      clinical evolution of the disease, in melanoma patients' T cells.

TI  - GATA-3 is upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients
      with minimal change nephrotic syndrome.
PG  - 608-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: An imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines has been reported in
      MCNS. Interleukin-13 (IL-13: Th2 cytokine) has been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of MCNS, but Th1/Th2 regulators such as T-bet (Th1-specific
      transcription factor) and GATA-3 (Th2-specific transcription factor) have
      not been examined. METHODS: We isolated PBMC from 25 patients with MCNS
      during nephrosis and remission phases, from 17 nephrotic patients with
      membranous nephropathy (MN), and from 25 healthy subjects. We measured
      mRNA expression levels of T-bet, GATA-3, Stat5A (regulator of Th2
      priming), IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokine), IL-2 (Th1 cytokine and activator of
      Stat5), IL-4 (Th2 cytokine), and IL-13 in PBMC, using real-time RT-PCR.
      RESULTS: GATA-3, Stat5A, and IL-13 mRNA expression levels were higher in
      the nephrotic MCNS group compared to the others. IL-2 mRNA expression
      levels were higher in nephrotic patients with MCNS and MN than in MCNS
      patients in remission and healthy controls. There were no differences in
      mRNA expression levels of T-bet, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 between MCNS and MN
      patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to
      reveal increased mRNA expression levels of GATA-3 and Stat5A in PBMC from
      MCNS patients in nephrosis. This study also supports recent findings
      suggesting the role of IL-13 in the development of MCNS. A predominant Th2
      type of T cell activation may be involved in the pathogenesis of MCNS.

TI  - CARMA1 controls an early checkpoint in the thymic development of FoxP3+
      regulatory T cells.
PG  - 6736-43
AB  - Natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) that develop in the thymus are
      essential to limit immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. However, the
      steps necessary for their thymic development are incompletely understood.
      The CARMA1/Bcl10/Malt1 (CBM) complex, comprised of adaptors that link the
      TCR to the transcription factor NF-kappaB, is required for development of
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) but not conventional T cells. Current models
      propose that TCR-NF-kappaB is needed in a Treg-extrinsic manner for IL-2
      production by conventional T cells or in already precommitted Treg
      precursors for driving IL-2/STAT5 responsiveness and further maturation
      into Tregs and/or for promoting cell survival. Using CARMA1-knockout mice,
      our data show instead that the CBM complex is needed in a Treg-intrinsic
      rather than -extrinsic manner. Constitutive activity of STAT5 or
      protection from apoptosis by transgenic expression of Bcl2 in developing
      Tregs is not sufficient to rescue CARMA1-knockout Treg development.
      Instead, our results demonstrate that the CBM complex controls an early
      checkpoint in Treg development by enabling generation of thymic precursors
      of Tregs. These data suggest a modified model of nTreg development in
      which TCR-CBM-dependent signals are essential to commit immature
      thymocytes to the nTreg lineage.

TI  - Responsiveness of T cells to interleukin-7 is associated with higher CD4+
      T cell counts in HIV-1-positive individuals with highly active
      antiretroviral therapy-induced viral load suppression.
PG  - 1872-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1
      (HIV-1) load by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), recovery of
      CD4+ T cell counts can be impaired. We investigated whether this
      impairment may be associated with hyporesponsiveness of T cells to
      gamma-chain (gammac) cytokines known to influence T cell homeostasis.
      METHODS: The responsiveness of T cells to interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, and
      IL-15 was determined by assessing cytokine-induced phosphorylation of the
      signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in peripheral T
      cells obtained from 118 HIV-positive subjects and 13 HIV-negative
      subjects. RESULTS: The responsiveness of T cells to interleukin (IL)-7 but
      not to IL-2 or IL-15 was lower among HIV-positive subjects than among
      HIV-negative subjects. Among subjects with viral load suppression, the
      degree of IL-7 responsiveness (1) correlated with naive CD4+ T cell counts
      and was a better immune correlate of the prevailing CD4+ T cell count than
      were levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR1 or programmed death-1, which
      are predictors of T cell homeostasis during HIV infection; and (2) was
      greater in subjects with complete (i.e., attainment of >or=500 CD4+ T
      cells/mm3>or=5 years after initiation of HAART) versus incomplete
      immunologic responses. The correlation between plasma levels of IL-7 and
      CD4+ T cell counts during HAART was maximal in subjects with increased
      IL-7 responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Responsiveness of T cells to IL-7 is
      associated with higher CD4+ T cell counts during HAART and thus may be a
      determinant of the extent of immune reconstitution.

TI  - A programmed switch from IL-15- to IL-2-dependent activation in human NK
      cells.
PG  - 6267-77
AB  - IL-2 and IL-15 differentially control the development, activation and
      proliferation of human NK cells, although they share common
      signal-transducing receptor chains CD122 and common gamma. To explore this
      issue, we analyzed in detail the kinetics of cytokine receptor expression,
      cytokine binding, and signaling responses in human NK cells treated with
      common gamma-chain family cytokines. We provide evidence for the
      sequential expression of IL-15Ralpha and IL-2Ralpha at the surface of
      cytokine-stimulated human NK cells, independent of the cytokine used for
      stimulation (IL-2, IL-15, or IL-7). Binding experiments confirmed the
      switch of high-affinity receptor from IL-15R to IL-2R between 18 and 48 h
      after stimulation. Consequently, phospho-STAT5 signaling responses to
      IL-15 were efficient in human NK cells pretreated with cytokines for 18 h,
      but were abolished at 48 h. Functional NK cell responses to IL-15,
      including IFN-gamma secretion and CD107a expression, followed a similar
      pattern, indicating the physiological relevance of the cytokine receptor
      switch. Importantly, IL-15 complexed to soluble IL-15Ralpha preserved the
      capacity to activate cytokine-stimulated human NK cells at 48 h,
      suggesting that human NK cells remained competent for IL-15
      trans-presentation, while they had become refractory to free diffusible
      IL-15. These findings define a common cytokine receptor expression
      program, which increases human NK cell sensitivity to free IL-15 in early
      activation and redirects responses toward IL-2 and trans-presented IL-15
      at later stages. Such a program may prevent excessive human NK cell
      activation by effectors of innate immunity and regulate the transition
      between the innate and adaptive stages of immune responses.

TI  - WIP is critical for T cell responsiveness to IL-2.
PG  - 7519-24
AB  - The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) interacting protein (WIP) stabilizes
      the WAS protein (WASP), the product of the gene mutated in WAS.
      WIP-deficient T cells have low WASP levels, limiting the usefulness of WIP
      KO mice in defining the role of WIP in T cell function. To define this
      role, we compared WIP/WASP double KO (DKO) mice to WASP KO mice on DO11.10
      background. T cell development was normal in both strains, but peripheral
      T cell numbers were significantly decreased in DKO mice. WASP KO T cells
      proliferated and secreted IL-2 normally in response to OVA peptide (OVAp).
      In contrast, T cells from DKO mice proliferated poorly in response to OVAp
      in vitro, and cutaneous hapten hypersensitivity was deficient in these
      mice. DKO T cells up-regulated CD25 expression and secreted normal amounts
      of IL-2 after antigen stimulation, but had defective response to IL-2,
      evidenced by failure to further up-regulate CD25 expression, phosphorylate
      STAT5, and induce expression of STAT5-dependent genes. DKO, but not WASP
      KO, T cells had a disrupted subcortical actin cytoskeleton and impaired
      actin polymerization after T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation. These
      results indicate that WIP is essential for IL-2 signaling and
      responsiveness in T cells, possibly because of its critical role in
      TCR-triggered actin cytoskeletal reorganization.

TI  - Interleukin-7 receptor signaling is deficient in CD4+ T cells from
      HIV-infected persons and is inversely associated with aging.
PG  - 1019-28
AB  - Loss of interleukin-7 (IL-2) receptor expression has been described in T
      lymphocytes from persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection, potentially contributing to perturbations in T cell
      homeostasis. We investigated IL-7 receptor signaling by measuring signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation in
      CD4+ T cell subsets from HIV-infected persons. We determined that CD45RA-
      memory cell subsets (both CD27+ and CD27-) displayed the most robust
      immediate responses to IL-7, whereas naive CD4+ T cells sustained the
      signal most efficiently. Memory CD4+ T cells with a terminal phenotype
      (CD45RA+CD27-) responded poorly to IL-7 stimulation. Defects in signaling
      were observed in cells from viremic HIV-infected persons and were
      especially pronounced in CD45RA-CD27- memory subset. Although CD127
      expression was diminished for T cells from HIV-infected persons, it was
      not directly related to IL-7 receptor signaling function. Instead, age was
      inversely related to IL-7 signaling in cells from both HIV-infected
      viremic subjects and healthy control subjects. Thus, HIV infection results
      in impaired IL-7 responsiveness, especially in memory CD4+ T cells, and
      this defect is likely compounded by aging.

TI  - T cell growth control using hapten-specific antibody/interleukin-2
      receptor chimera.
PG  - 127-36
AB  - IL-2 is a cytokine that is essential for the expansion and survival of
      activated T cells. Although adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells
      with IL-2 is one of strategies for cancer immunotherapy, it is essential
      to replace IL-2 that exerts severe side effects in vivo. To solve this
      problem, we propose to use an antibody/IL-2R chimera, which can transduce
      a growth signal in response to a cognate antigen. We constructed two
      chimeras, in which ScFv of anti-fluorescein antibody was tethered to
      extracellular D2 domain of erythropoietin receptor and
      transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of IL-2Rbeta or gamma chain. When the
      chimeras were co-expressed in IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3 and
      IL-2-dependent T cell line CTLL-2, gene-modified cells were selectively
      expanded in the absence of IL-3 and IL-2, respectively, by adding
      fluorescein-conjugated BSA (BSA-FL) as a cognate antigen. Growth assay
      revealed that the cells with the chimeras transduced a growth signal in a
      BSA-FL dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2 and Akt,
      which are hallmarks for IL-2R signaling, were all activated by the
      chimeras in CTLL-2 transfectant. We also demonstrated that the chimeras
      were functional in murine primary T cells. These results demonstrate that
      the antibody/IL-2R chimeras could substantially mimic the wild-type IL-2R
      and could specifically expand gene-modified T cells in the presence of the
      cognate antigen.

TI  - A low interleukin-2 receptor signaling threshold supports the development
      and homeostasis of T regulatory cells.
PG  - 204-17
AB  - Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling is essential for T regulatory
      (Treg) cell development and homeostasis. Here, we show that expression of
      IL-2Rbeta chains that lack tyrosine residues important for the association
      of the adaptor Shc and the transcription factor STAT5 in
      IL-2Rbeta-deficient mice resulted in production of a normal proportion of
      natural Treg cells that suppressed severe autoimmunity related with
      deficiency in IL-2 or IL-2R. These mutant IL-2Rbeta chains supported
      suboptimal and transient STAT5 activation that upregulate the
      transcription factor Foxp3 to normal amounts in natural, but not induced,
      Treg cells. Nevertheless, gene expression profiling revealed many targets
      in peripheral natural Treg cells that were IL-2 dependent and a
      substantial overlap between the Treg cell IL-2-dependent gene program and
      the Treg cell transcriptional signature. Collectively, these findings
      demonstrate that a critical, and perhaps minor, subset of IL-2-dependent
      targets is indexed to a low IL-2R signaling threshold and that a
      substantial proportion of the Treg cell gene program is regulated by IL-2.

TI  - IRX-2, a novel immunotherapeutic, protects human T cells from
      tumor-induced cell death.
PG  - 708-18
AB  - IRX-2 is a cytokine-based biologic agent that has the potential to enhance
      antitumor immune responses. We investigated whether IRX-2 can protect T
      cells from tumor-induced apoptosis. Tumor-derived microvesicles (MV)
      expressing FasL were purified from supernatants of tumor cells and
      incubated with activated CD8(+) T cells. MV induced significant CD8(+)
      T-cell apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin binding (64.4+/-6.4%), caspase
      activation (58.1+/-7.6%), a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
      (82.9+/-3.9%) and DNA fragmentation. T-cell pretreatment with IRX-2
      prevented apoptosis. IRX-2-mediated cytoprotection was dose and time
      dependent and was comparable to effects of IL-2, IL-7 or IL-15. IRX-2
      prevented MV-induced downregulation of JAK3 and TCRzeta chain and induced
      STAT5 activation in T cells. IRX-2 prevented MV-induced Bax and Bim
      upregulation (P<0.005-0.05), prevented cytochrome c release and Bid
      cleavage, and concurrently restored the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, FLIP
      and Mcl-1 (P<0.005-0.01) in T cells. In addition, IRX-2 reversed
      MV-induced inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. An Akt inhibitor (Akti-1/2)
      abrogated protective effects of IRX-2, suggesting that Akt is a downstream
      target of IRX-2 signaling. Thus, ex vivo pretreatment of CD8(+) T cells
      with IRX-2 provided potent protection from tumor-induced apoptosis. IRX-2
      application to future cancer biotherapies could improve their
      effectiveness by bolstering T-cell resistance to tumor-induced
      immunosuppression.

TI  - Natural agonists for aryl hydrocarbon receptor in culture medium are
      essential for optimal differentiation of Th17 T cells.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - Th17 cell differentiation is dependent on interleukin (IL)-6 and
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and it is modulated by activation
      of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In this study, we show that
      differentiation of Th17 cells, but not Th1 or induced regulatory T (iT
      reg) cells, is increased by endogenous AhR agonists present in culture
      medium. Th17 development from wild-type mice is suboptimal in the presence
      of the AhR antagonist CH-223191, similar to the situation in AhR-deficient
      mice, which show attenuated IL-17 production and no IL-22 production. The
      presence of natural AhR agonists in culture medium is also revealed by the
      induction of CYP1A1, a downstream target of AhR activation. However, the
      most commonly used medium, RPMI, supports very low levels of Th17
      polarization, whereas Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, a medium richer
      in aromatic amino acids, which give rise to AhR agonists, consistently
      results in higher Th17 expansion in both mouse and human cells. The
      relative paucity of AhR agonists in RPMI medium, coupled with the presence
      of factors conducive to IL-2 activation and enhanced Stat5
      phosphorylation, conspire against optimal Th17 differentiation. Our data
      emphasize that AhR activation plays an essential part in the development
      of Th17 cells and provide a rational explanation for the poor in vitro
      polarization of Th17 cells that is reported in the majority of
      publications for both mouse and human cells.

TI  - CCR5 expression levels influence NFAT translocation, IL-2 production, and
      subsequent signaling events during T lymphocyte activation.
PG  - 171-82
AB  - Ligands of CCR5, the major coreceptor of HIV-1, costimulate T lymphocyte
      activation. However, the full impact of CCR5 expression on T cell
      responses remains unknown. Here, we show that compared with CCR5(+/+), T
      cells from CCR5(-/-) mice secrete lower amounts of IL-2, and a similar
      phenotype is observed in humans who lack CCR5 expression
      (CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 homozygotes) as well as after Ab-mediated blockade
      of CCR5 in human T cells genetically intact for CCR5 expression.
      Conversely, overexpression of CCR5 in human T cells results in enhanced
      IL-2 production. CCR5 surface levels correlate positively with IL-2
      protein and mRNA abundance, suggesting that CCR5 affects IL-2 gene
      regulation. Signaling via CCR5 resulted in NFAT transactivation in T cells
      that was blocked by Abs against CCR5 agonists, suggesting a link between
      CCR5 and downstream pathways that influence IL-2 expression. Furthermore,
      murine T cells lacking CCR5 had reduced levels of intranuclear NFAT
      following activation. Accordingly, CCR5 expression also promoted
      IL-2-dependent events, including CD25 expression, STAT5 phosphorylation,
      and T cell proliferation. We therefore suggest that by influencing a
      NFAT-mediated pathway that regulates IL-2 production and IL-2-dependent
      events, CCR5 may play a critical role in T cell responses. In accord with
      our prior inferences from genetic-epidemiologic studies, such
      CCR5-dependent responses might constitute a viral entry-independent
      mechanism by which CCR5 may influence HIV-AIDS pathogenesis.

TI  - Inhibition of tumor growth by NK1.1+ cells and CD8+ T cells activated by
      IL-15 through receptor beta/common gamma signaling in trans.
PG  - 8237-47
AB  - IL-15 is an important cytokine involved in the survival and function of
      CD8(+) T cells and NK cells. IL-15 can be presented by IL-15Ralpha
      (IL-15RA) to bind with the shared IL-2/IL-15Rbeta and common gamma-chains,
      which activate signaling pathways on NK cells and CD8(+) T cells. In the
      present study, we characterized the function of trans-presented IL-15 on
      NK cells and CD8(+) T cells using TC-1 tumor cells transduced with a
      retrovirus encoding IL-15 linked to IL-15RA (IL-15/IL-15RA). We
      demonstrated that the expression of IL-15/IL-15RA on TC-1 cells led to
      increased percentages of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, NKT cells, and
      CD8(+) T cells, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth in challenged
      mice. Additionally, in vivo Ab depletion experiments demonstrated that
      NK1.1(+) cells and CD8(+) T cells were important in this inhibition of
      tumor growth. Furthermore, this accumulation of immune cells and
      inhibition of tumor growth was abolished by a single amino acid mutation
      in the common gamma-chain binding site on IL-15. We also observed that
      IL-15/IL-15RA-transduced TC-1 cells led to the activation of STAT5 in NK
      and CD8(+) T cells in trans, which was abolished in the mutated
      IL-15/IL-15RA-transduced TC-1 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that
      common gamma-chain binding-dependent activation of the shared
      IL-15/IL-2Rbeta/common gamma signaling pathway may play an important role
      in the activation of NK cells and CD8(+) T cells, resulting in
      IL-15/IL-15RA trans-presentation-mediated inhibition of tumor growth.

TI  - The common gamma-chain cytokines IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 induce the
      expression of programmed death-1 and its ligands.
PG  - 6738-46
AB  - The programmed death (PD)-1 molecule and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2),
      negative regulatory members of the B7 family, play an important role in
      peripheral tolerance. Previous studies have demonstrated that PD-1 is
      up-regulated on T cells following TCR-mediated activation; however, little
      is known regarding PD-1 and Ag-independent, cytokine-induced T cell
      activation. The common gamma-chain (gamma c) cytokines IL-2, IL-7, IL-15,
      and IL-21, which play an important role in peripheral T cell expansion and
      survival, were found to up-regulate PD-1 and, with the exception of IL-21,
      PD-L1 on purified T cells in vitro. This effect was most prominent on
      memory T cells. Furthermore, these cytokines induced, indirectly, the
      expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on monocytes/macrophages in PBMC. The in
      vivo correlate of these observations was confirmed on PBMC isolated from
      HIV-infected individuals receiving IL-2 immunotherapy. Exposure of gamma c
      cytokine pretreated T cells to PD-1 ligand-IgG had no effect on STAT5
      activation, T cell proliferation, or survival driven by gamma c cytokines.
      However, PD-1 ligand-IgG dramatically inhibited anti-CD3/CD28-driven
      proliferation and Lck activation. Furthermore, following restimulation
      with anti-CD3/CD28, cytokine secretion by both gamma c cytokine and
      anti-CD3/CD28 pretreated T cells was suppressed. These data suggest that
      gamma c cytokine-induced PD-1 does not interfere with cytokine-driven
      peripheral T cell expansion/survival, but may act to suppress certain
      effector functions of cytokine-stimulated cells upon TCR engagement,
      thereby minimizing immune-mediated damage to the host.

TI  - SHD1 is a novel cytokine-inducible, negative feedback regulator of
      STAT5-dependent transcription.
PG  - 1027-36
AB  - STAT5 is a critical mediator of a variety of cytokine signaling whose
      transcriptional activity is regulated by associating with various
      proteins. During a search for STAT5-interacting proteins, we identified
      SHD1, a mammalian homologue of yeast gene Sac3, as a potential interacter.
      SHD1 was localized in the nucleus, and induced by cytokines that activate
      STAT5, such as erythropoietin, interleukin-2 (IL-2), or IL-3. SHD1
      interacted specifically with STAT5A and STAT5B, and interestingly, it
      specifically repressed STAT5-dependent transcription in vitro without
      affecting the stability or phosphorylation of STAT5 protein. Gene
      disruption study revealed that T, B, or bone marrow cells from mice
      lacking SHD1 were hyperresponsive to T-cell-receptor engagement, or
      stimulation with various STAT5-activating cytokines. These results suggest
      that SHD1 is a novel cytokine-inducible negative feedback regulator of
      STAT5.

TI  - Priming for T helper type 2 differentiation by interleukin 2-mediated
      induction of interleukin 4 receptor alpha-chain expression.
PG  - 1288-96
AB  - T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cells are essential for humoral immunity and host
      defense. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) drives T(H)2 differentiation and IL-2
      augments the accessibility of Il4 chromatin. Here we demonstrate that
      IL-2, by inducing binding of STAT5 to the Il4ra locus, which encodes IL-4
      receptor alpha-chain (IL-4Ralpha), was essential for inducing and
      maintaining IL-4Ralpha expression. Although IL-4 induced IL-4Ralpha
      expression, T cell receptor-induced IL-4Ralpha expression was normal in
      Il4(-/-) cells but was much lower in Il2(-/-) cells. Notably, forced
      IL-4Ralpha expression restored the T(H)2 differentiation of Il2(-/-)
      cells. Moreover, genome-wide mapping by chromatin immunoprecipitation
      coupled with sequencing showed broad interaction of the transcription
      factors STAT5A and STAT5B with genes associated with T(H)2
      differentiation. Our results identify a previously unappreciated function
      for IL-2 in 'priming' T cells for T(H)2 differentiation and in maintaining
      the expression of Il4ra and other genes in T(H)2-committed cells.

TI  - The production of IL-10 by human regulatory T cells is enhanced by IL-2
      through a STAT5-responsive intronic enhancer in the IL-10 locus.
PG  - 3897-905
AB  - STAT5 molecules are key components of the IL-2 signaling pathway, the
      deficiency of which often results in autoimmune pathology due to a reduced
      number of CD4(+)CD25(+) naturally occurring regulatory T (Treg) cells. One
      of the consequences of the IL-2-STAT5 signaling axis is up-regulation of
      FOXP3, a master control gene for naturally occurring Treg cells. However,
      the roles of STAT5 in other Treg subsets have not yet been elucidated. We
      recently demonstrated that IL-2 enhanced IL-10 production through STAT5
      activation. This occurred in two types of human Treg cells: a novel type
      of umbilical cord blood-derived Treg cell, termed HOZOT, and Tr1-like Treg
      cells, IL-10-Treg. In this study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of
      IL-10 production in these Treg cells, focusing specifically on the roles
      of STAT5. By performing bioinformatic analysis on the IL-10 locus, we
      identified one STAT-responsive element within intron 4, designated
      I-SRE-4, as an interspecies-conserved sequence. We found that I-SRE-4
      acted as an enhancer element, and clustered CpGs around the I-SRE-4 were
      hypomethylated in IL-10-producing Treg cells, but not in other T cells. A
      gel-shift analysis using a nuclear extract from IL-2-stimulated HOZOT
      confirmed that CpG DNA methylation around I-SRE-4 reduced STAT5 binding to
      the element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the in situ
      binding of IL-2-activated STAT5 to I-SRE-4. Thus, we provide molecular
      evidence for the involvement of an IL-2-STAT5 signaling axis in the
      expression of IL-10 by human Treg cells, an axis that is regulated by the
      intronic enhancer, I-SRE-4, and epigenetic modification of this element.

TI  - IL-2, -7, and -15, but not thymic stromal lymphopoeitin, redundantly
      govern CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell development.
PG  - 3285-90
AB  - Common gamma chain (gammac)-receptor dependent cytokines are required for
      regulatory T cell (Treg) development as gammac(-/-) mice lack Tregs.
      However, it is unclear which gammac-dependent cytokines are involved in
      this process. Furthermore, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has also
      been suggested to play a role in Treg development. In this study, we
      demonstrate that developing CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs in the thymus express the
      IL-2Rbeta, IL-4Ralpha, IL-7Ralpha, IL-15Ralpha, and IL-21Ralpha chains,
      but not the IL9Ralpha or TSLPRalpha chains. Moreover, only IL-2, and to a
      much lesser degree IL-7 and IL-15, were capable of transducing signals in
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs as determined by monitoring STAT5 phosphorylation.
      Likewise, IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, but not TSLP, were capable of inducing
      the conversion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(-) thymic Treg progenitors into
      CD4(+)Foxp3(+) mature Tregs in vitro. To examine this issue in more
      detail, we generated IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-7Ralpha(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x
      IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice. We found that IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x IL-7Ralpha(-/-) mice
      were devoid of Tregs thereby recapitulating the phenotype observed in
      gammac(-/-) mice; in contrast, the phenotype observed in IL-2Rbeta(-/-) x
      IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice was comparable to that seen in IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice.
      Finally, we observed that Tregs from both IL-2(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-)
      mice show elevated expression of IL-7Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha chains.
      Addition of IL-2 to Tregs from IL-2(-/-) mice led to rapid down-regulation
      of these receptors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IL-2
      plays the predominant role in Treg development, but that in its absence
      the IL-7Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha chains are up-regulated and allow for IL-7
      and IL-15 to partially compensate for loss of IL-2.

      dependent on exogenous IL-2. IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21, all of which signals
      through receptors containing the common gamma chain, induced expression of
      IL-10 in the IL-2-dependent cell lines as well as primary leukemic CTCL
      cells. However, only IL-2 and IL-15, but not IL-21, induced expression of
      FOXP3. The IL-2-triggered induction of IL-10 and FOXP3 expression occurred
      by signaling through STAT3 and STAT5, respectively. Immunohistochemical
      analysis of the CTCL tissues revealed that FOXP3-expressing cells were
      common among the CD7-negative enlarged atypical and small lymphocytes at
      the early skin patch and plaque stages. Their frequency was profoundly
      diminished at the tumor stage and in the CTCL lymph node lesions with or
      without large cell transformation. These results indicate that the T
      regulatory cell features are induced in CTCL T cells by common gamma chain
      signaling cytokines such as IL-2 and do not represent a fully
      predetermined, constitutive phenotype independent of the local
      environmental stimuli to which these malignant mature CD4(+) T cells
      become exposed.

PG  - 238-48
AB  - T cells slow their motility, increase adherence, and arrest after
      encounters with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) bearing peptide-MHC
      complexes. Here, we analyzed the cell-cell communication among activating
      T cells. In vivo and in vitro, activating T cells associated in large
      clusters that collectively persisted for >30 min, but they also engaged in
      more transient interactions, apparently distal to APCs. Homotypic
      aggregation was driven by LFA-1 integrin interactions. Ultrastructural
      analysis revealed that cell-cell contacts between activating T cells were
      organized as multifocal synapses, and T cells oriented both the
      microtubule-organizing complex and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion toward
      this synapse. T cells engaged in homotypic interactions more effectively
      captured IL-2 relative to free cells. T cells receiving paracrine synaptic
      IL-2 polarized their IL-2 signaling subunits into the synaptic region and
      more efficiently phosphorylated the transcription factor STAT5, likely
      through a synapse-associated signaling complex. Thus, synapse-mediated
      cytokine delivery accelerates responses in activating T cells.

      role of JAK/STAT- and MAPK-signaling pathways]
PG  - 329-37
AB  - In interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced human blood lymphocytes, the Na+/K+ pump
      function (assessed by ouabain-sensitive Rb+ influx), the abundance of Na+,
      K+-ATPase alpha1-subunit (determined by Western blotting) and the alpha1-
      and beta1-subunits mRNA of Na+, K+-ATPase (RT-PCR), as well as the
      phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT3 family proteins and ERK1/2 kinase have
      been examined. A 3.5-4.0-fold increase in the expression of alpha1- and
      beta1-subunits mRNA of Na+, K+-ATPase was found at 24 h of IL-2
      stimulation. The inhibitors of JAK3 kinase (B-42, WHI-P431) was shown to
      decrease both the phosphorylation of STATs and the rise in the
      oubain-sensitive rubidium influx as well as the increased abundance of
      Na+, K+-ATPase alpha1-subunit. The inhibition of the protein kinases
      ERK1/2 by PD98059 (20 microM) suppressed the alpha1-subunit accumulation.
      All the kinase inhibitors tested did not alter the intracellular content
      ofmonovalent cations in resting and IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes. It is
      concluded that MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways mediate the
      IL-2-dependent regulation of the Na+, K+-ATPase expression during the
      lymphocyte transition from resting stage to proliferation.

TI  - The influence of IL-2 family cytokines on activation and function of
      naturally occurring regulatory T cells.
PG  - 973-80
AB  - IL-2 is essential for CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3+ (FoxP3+) naturally
      occurring regulatory T cell (Treg) homeostasis and activation. Binding of
      IL-2 to its receptor leads to phosphorylation of STAT5, and binding of
      phosphorylated STAT5 to the foxp3 promoter increases foxp3 transcription,
      resulting in elevated levels of FoxP3 protein in Tregs. Transcriptional
      regulation by the elevated levels of FoxP3 is thought to be essential for
      the strong suppressor function seen in activated Tregs. IL-2 belongs to a
      family cytokines, which all depend on the common gamma-receptor chain
      (gammac). Given the well-documented effects of IL-2 on Treg function, the
      effect of other IL-2 family cytokines (IL-7, -15, and -21) on Tregs was
      examined. We observed that IL-7 and IL-15 induce STAT5 phosphorylation and
      up-regulation of FoxP3 in Tregs. STAT5 activation correlated with enhanced
      viability. However, only in the presence of IL-2 did Tregs acquire potent
      suppressor function. This finding is surprising, as IL-15 as well as IL-2
      use the same IL-2R betac and gammac for signaling. In contrast, IL-21
      activated STAT3 but did not activate STAT5 and had no effect on Treg
      viability, activation, or function. We therefore conclude that
      phosphorylation of STAT5, mediated through the IL-2Rgamma, promotes Treg
      survival in a resting and activated state. However, activation of STAT5
      alone in conjunction with TCR signaling is not sufficient for the
      induction of potent suppressor function in Tregs, as IL-7 and IL-15 are
      not capable of inducing potent Treg suppressor function.

TI  - IL-2 receptor beta-chain signaling controls immunosuppressive CD4+ T cells
      in the draining lymph nodes and lung during allergic airway inflammation
      in vivo.
PG  - 1917-26
AB  - IL-2 influences both survival and differentiation of CD4(+) T effector and
      regulatory T cells. We studied the effect of i.n. administration of Abs
      against the alpha- and the beta-chains of the IL-2R in a murine model of
      allergic asthma. Blockade of the beta- but not the alpha-chain of the
      IL-2R after allergen challenge led to a significant reduction of airway
      hyperresponsiveness. Although both treatments led to reduction of lung
      inflammation, IL-2 signaling, STAT-5 phosphorylation, and Th2-type
      cytokine production (IL-4 and IL-5) by lung T cells, IL-13 production and
      CD4(+) T cell survival were solely inhibited by the blockade of the IL-2R
      beta-chain. Moreover, local blockade of the common IL-2R/IL-15R beta-chain
      reduced NK cell number and IL-2 production by lung CD4(+)CD25(+) and
      CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells while inducing IL-10- and TGF-beta-producing CD4(+)
      T cells in the lung. This cytokine milieu was associated with reduced
      CD4(+) T cell proliferation in the draining lymph nodes. Thus, local
      blockade of the beta-chain of the IL-2R restored an immunosuppressive
      cytokine milieu in the lung that ameliorated both inflammation and airway
      hyperresponsiveness in experimental allergic asthma. These findings
      provide novel insights into the functional role of IL-2 signaling in
      experimental asthma and suggest that blockade of the IL-2R beta-chain
      might be useful for therapy of allergic asthma in humans.

TI  - Selective expansion of genetically modified T cells using an
      antibody/interleukin-2 receptor chimera.
PG  - 16-23
AB  - Although adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells is a plausible
      approach for cancer immunotherapy, the therapeutic application was
      hampered due to severe side effects caused by administration of high-dose
      interleukin (IL)-2, which was used for long-lasting maintenance of
      tumor-specific T cells in vivo. To solve this problem, here we propose to
      use an antibody/IL-2 receptor chimera, which can transduce a growth signal
      in response to a cognate antigen. As a model system, V(H) or V(L) region
      of anti-hen egg lysozyme (HEL) antibody HyHEL-10 was tethered to
      extracellular D2 domain of erythropoietin receptor and
      transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of IL-2 receptor beta or gamma chain.
      When the pairs of chimeric receptors (V(H)-IL-2Rbeta and V(L)-IL-2Rgamma,
      or V(H)-IL-2Rgamma and V(L)-IL-2Rbeta) were expressed in IL-3-dependent
      pro-B cell line Ba/F3 and IL-2-dependent T cell line CTLL-2, the cognate
      antigen HEL induced selective expansion of gene-modified cells in the
      absence of IL-3 and IL-2, respectively. Growth assay revealed that the
      combination of V(H)-IL-2Rbeta and V(L)-IL-2Rgamma transduced a more
      stringent HEL-dependent growth signal, indicating some conformational
      effects of the chimeras. Furthermore, STAT3, STAT5 and ERK1/2, which are
      hallmarks for IL-2R signaling, were all activated by the antibody/IL-2R
      chimeras. These results clearly demonstrate that the antibody/IL-2R
      chimeras could substantially mimic the wild-type IL-2R signaling,
      suggesting the potential application in expansion of gene-modified T
      cells.

TI  - Late expression of granulysin by microbicidal CD4+ T cells requires PI3K-
      and STAT5-dependent expression of IL-2Rbeta that is defective in
      HIV-infected patients.
PG  - 7221-9
AB  - Granulysin is a cytolytic effector molecule used by lymphocytes to kill
      tumor and microbial cells. Regulation of granulysin production is complex.
      A significant delay (5 days) following stimulation of CD4(+) T cells with
      IL-2 occurs before granulysin is produced. Unfortunately, the mechanisms
      responsible for this delay are unknown. We have recently demonstrated that
      granulysin-mediated killing of Cryptococcus neoformans by CD4(+) T cells
      is defective during HIV infection. This is because CD4(+) T cells from
      HIV-infected patients fail to produce granulysin in response to IL-2
      activation. The present studies examined the mechanism of delayed
      production of granulysin and the mechanism of the defect in HIV patients.
      We demonstrate that IL-2 initially requires both STAT5 and PI3K activation
      to increase expression of IL-2Rbeta, produce granulysin, and kill C.
      neoformans. The increased expression of IL-2Rbeta precedes granulysin, and
      preventing the increased expression of IL-2Rbeta using small interfering
      RNA knockdown abrogates granulysin expression. Moreover, following the
      increased expression of IL-2Rbeta, blocking subsequent signaling by IL-2
      using IL-2Rbeta-specific blocking Abs abrogates expression of granulysin.
      Finally, CD4(+) T cells from HIV-infected patients, who are defective in
      both STAT5 and PI3K signaling, fail to express IL-2Rbeta and fail to
      produce granulysin. These results suggest that IL-2 signals via PI3K and
      STAT5 to increase expression of IL-2Rbeta, which in turn is required for
      production of granulysin. These results provide a mechanism to explain the
      "late" production of granulysin during normal T cell responses, as well as
      for defective granulysin production by CD4(+) T cells in HIV-infected
      patients.

TI  - Novel and highly recurrent chromosomal alterations in Sezary syndrome.
PG  - 2689-98
AB  - This study was designed to identify highly recurrent genetic alterations
      typical of Sezary syndrome (Sz), an aggressive cutaneous T-cell
      lymphoma/leukemia, possibly revealing pathogenetic mechanisms and novel
      therapeutic targets. High-resolution array-based comparative genomic
      hybridization was done on malignant T cells from 20 patients. Expression
      levels of selected biologically relevant genes residing within loci with
      frequent copy number alteration were measured using quantitative PCR.
      Combined binary ratio labeling-fluorescence in situ hybridization
      karyotyping was done on malignant cells from five patients. Minimal common
      regions with copy number alteration occurring in at least 35% of patients
      harbored 15 bona fide oncogenes and 3 tumor suppressor genes. Based on the
      function of the identified oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, at least
      three molecular mechanisms are relevant in the pathogenesis of Sz. First,
      gain of cMYC and loss of cMYC antagonists (MXI1 and MNT) were observed in
      75% and 40% to 55% of patients, respectively, which were frequently
      associated with deregulated gene expression. The presence of cMYC/MAX
      protein heterodimers in Sezary cells was confirmed using a proximity
      ligation assay. Second, a region containing TP53 and genome maintenance
      genes (RPA1/HIC1) was lost in the majority of patients. Third, the
      interleukin 2 (IL-2) pathway was affected by gain of STAT3/STAT5 and IL-2
      (receptor) genes in 75% and 30%, respectively, and loss of TCF8 and DUSP5
      in at least 45% of patients. In sum, the Sz genome is characterized by
      gross chromosomal instability with highly recurrent gains and losses.
      Prominent among deregulated genes are those encoding cMYC, cMYC-regulating
      proteins, mediators of MYC-induced apoptosis, and IL-2 signaling pathway
      components.

TI  - Differential regulation of the IL-17 receptor by gammac cytokines:
      inhibitory signaling by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.
PG  - 14100-8
AB  - The gammac-family cytokine IL-2 activates signaling events that contribute
      to cell survival and proliferation, the best-studied of which are the
      STAT-5 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. The starting
      point of this study was to define genes regulated by the IL-2R-mediated
      PI3K pathway in T cells. Accordingly, we used an erythropoietin (EPO)
      receptor chimeric receptor system in which IL-2-dependent HT-2 T cells
      expressed a mutant EPO-IL-2Rbeta construct where Tyr-338 is mutated to
      Phe. Cells expressing this mutant IL-2Rbeta chain fail to induce
      phosphorylation of PI3K-p85alpha/beta or activate Akt, but mediate normal
      IL-2-dependent proliferation and activation of JAK1 and STAT-5A/B.
      Microarray analyses revealed differential regulation of numerous genes
      compared with cells expressing a wild-type IL-2Rbeta, including
      up-regulation of the IL-17 receptor subunit IL-17RA. Blockade of the PI3K
      pathway but not p70S6K led to up-regulation of IL-17RA, and constitutive
      Akt activation was associated with suppressed IL-17RA expression.
      Moreover, similar to the mutant EPO-IL-2Rbeta chimera, IL-15 and IL-21
      induced IL-17RA preferentially compared with IL-2, and IL-2 but not IL-15
      or IL-21 mediated prolonged activation of the PI3K p85 regulatory subunit.
      Thus, there are intrinsic signaling differences between IL-2 and IL-15
      that can be attributed to differences in activation of the PI3K pathway.

PG  - 207-12
AB  - Naturally occurred CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells derived from thymus.
      It plays an important role in self-tolerance and allograft-tolerance
      through cell-contact dependent mechanism. This review described the
      advances of study on the probable regulatory factors of the naturally
      occurring regulatory T cells, such as Foxp3, IL-2, TGF-beta(1), dendritic
      cells and CTLA-4. As a marker of Treg, the expression of Foxp3 could be
      used to identify regulatory T cells. The combination of interferon 2 and
      IL-2Ralpha would activate Treg and promote its proliferation through the
      phosphorylation of STAT5. TGF-beta(1) on the cell surface may influence
      the function of Treg, while the secretion type of TGF-beta may promote the
      proliferation of Treg. Dendritic cells can positively or negatively
      regulate Treg, which depends on the signal transduction pathway. CTLA-4
      expressed on the surface of Treg might bind to the B7 molecule on the DC,
      effective cell or Treg itself directly or indirectly regulate Treg.

TI  - STAT3 is indispensable to IL-27-mediated cell proliferation but not to
      IL-27-induced Th1 differentiation and suppression of proinflammatory
      cytokine production.
PG  - 2903-11
AB  - IL-27, a member of the IL-6/IL-12 family, activates both STAT1 and STAT3
      through its receptor, which consists of WSX-1 and gp130 subunits,
      resulting in augmentation of Th1 differentiation and suppression of
      proinflammatory cytokine production. In the present study, we investigated
      the role of STAT3 in the IL-27-mediated immune functions. IL-27 induced
      phosphorylation of STAT1, -2, -3 and -5 in wild-type naive CD4+ T cells,
      but failed to induce that of STAT3 and STAT5 in STAT3-deficient cohorts.
      IL-27 induced not only proinflammatory responses including up-regulation
      of ICAM-1, T-box expressed in T cells, and IL-12Rbeta2 and Th1
      differentiation, but also anti-inflammatory responses including
      suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production such as IL-2, IL-4, and
      IL-13 even in STAT3-deficient naive CD4+ T cells. In contrast, IL-27
      augmented c-Myc and Pim-1 expression and induced cell proliferation in
      wild-type naive CD4+ T cells but not in STAT3-deficient cohorts. Moreover,
      IL-27 failed to activate STAT3, augment c-Myc and Pim-1 expression, and
      induce cell proliferation in pro-B BaF/3 transfectants expressing mutant
      gp130, in which the putative STAT3-binding four Tyr residues in the YXXQ
      motif of the cytoplasmic region was replaced by Phe. These results suggest
      that STAT3 is activated through gp130 by IL-27 and is indispensable to
      IL-27-mediated cell proliferation but not to IL-27-induced Th1
      differentiation and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production.
      Thus, IL-27 may be a cytokine, which activates both STAT1 and STAT3
      through distinct receptor subunits, WSX-1 and gp130, respectively, to
      mediate its individual immune functions.

TI  - STAT5-signaling cytokines regulate the expression of FOXP3 in CD4+CD25+
      regulatory T cells and CD4+CD25- effector T cells.
PG  - 421-31
AB  - Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is considered a specific marker for CD4(+)CD25(+)
      regulatory T (Treg) cells, but increasing evidence suggests that human
      CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T (Teff) cells can transiently express FOXP3 upon
      activation. We demonstrate that the signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 5 (STAT5)-signaling cytokines, IL-2, IL-15 and to a lesser
      extent IL-7, induce FOXP3 up-regulation in vitro in activated human Teff
      cells. In contrast, cytokines which do not activate STAT5, such as IL-4 or
      transforming growth factor-beta alone, do not directly induce FOXP3
      expression in activated Teff cells. Moreover, expression of a
      constitutively active form of STAT5a is sufficient to induce FOXP3
      expression in Teff cells. Expression of FOXP3 in activated Teff cells
      requires both TCR-mediated activation and endogenous IL-2, but is not
      dependent on cell division and does not induce suppressive function. The
      presence of STAT5-activating cytokines is also required to maintain high
      FOXP3 expression and suppressive activity of Treg cells in vitro. These
      data indicate that activation of STAT5 sustains FOXP3 expression in both
      Treg and Teff cells and contribute to our understanding of how cytokines
      affect the expression of FOXP3.

TI  - Phosphorylation of human Jak3 at tyrosines 904 and 939 positively
      regulates its activity.
PG  - 2271-82
AB  - Janus tyrosine kinase 3 (Jak3) is essential for signaling by interleukin-2
      (IL-2) family cytokines and proper immune function. Dysfunctional
      regulation of Jak3 may result in certain disease states. However, the
      molecular mechanisms governing Jak3 activation are not fully understood.
      In this study, we used a functional-proteomics approach to identify two
      novel tyrosine phosphorylation sites within Jak3, Y904 and Y939, which are
      conserved among Jak family proteins. By using phosphospecific antibodies,
      both residues were observed to be rapidly induced by stimulation of cells
      with IL-2 or other gammac cytokines. Mechanistic studies indicated that
      Y904 and Y939 regulate Jak3 activities. A phenylalanine substitution at
      either site greatly reduced Jak3 kinase activity in vitro and its ability
      to phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription 5
      (Stat5) in vivo, suggesting that phosphorylation of these previously
      unrecognized residues positively regulates Jak3 activity. Y904 and Y939
      were required for optimal ATP usage by Jak3, while phosphorylation of Y939
      preferentially promoted Stat5 activity in intact cells. Together, these
      findings demonstrate positive functional roles for two novel Jak3
      phosphoregulatory sites which may be similarly important for other Jak
      family members. Identification of these sites also provides new
      therapeutic opportunities to modulate Jak3 function.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo effects of zinc on cytokine signalling in human T
      cells.
PG  - 472-82
AB  - Aging is associated with changes in the immune response which are
      collectively called immunosenescence. The changes mainly affect the
      adaptive immune response and especially the T cell-mediated cellular
      immune response. There are a few data indicating that the cytokine
      signalling in T cells is altered with aging. Zinc has been specifically
      shown to have potent immunomodulatory effects. The aim of the present work
      was to study the IL-2 and IL-6 cytokine signalling and activation induced
      cell death (AICD) in T cells of elderly subjects of various ages and from
      various European countries. These experiments were performed in the frame
      of European Community financed project called ZINCAGE "Nutritional zinc,
      oxidative stress and immunosenescence: biochemical, genetic and lifestyle
      implications for healthy ageing", assembling 17 laboratories from 8
      countries through Europe. The study was carried out in a total of 312
      French and a group of 201 (26 from Italy, 63 from France, 57 from Greece,
      24 from Poland and 30 from Germany) healthy non-institutionalized men and
      women older than 60 years of age, with available dietary data. Human
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from heparinized
      blood and were stimulated in vitro by IL-2 or IL-6 for various periods and
      the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 was measured by FACScan. The
      activation induced cell death (AICD) was measured after anti-CD3 and CD28
      restimulation for 48h by using the Annexin:FITC Apoptosis Kit. We found
      that there is an IL-2 signalling defect with aging up to 90 years of age
      which cannot be modulated by zinc. In contrast at 90 years and over the
      zinc could reverse the negative signalling effect of IL-2. There is also a
      signalling defect for STAT3 and STAT5 activation in T cells under IL-6
      stimulation with aging and the zinc supplementation could potentiate only
      the STAT5 activation in the age-group 90 years and over. Studying
      signalling in PBL from different countries we detected less activation in
      T cells of subjects from France and the most changes occurred in T cells
      of subjects from Poland, suggesting no correlation with the plasma zinc
      status observed in these countries. In vivo zinc supplementation had no
      effect on IL-2 and IL-6-modulated STAT3 and STAT5 activation. Zinc added
      in vitro to these T cells even inhibited the stimulation either by IL-2 or
      by IL-6. Zinc supplementation improved the susceptibility of T cells to
      AICD in both age-groups, with more efficiency in later ages. Our results
      suggest that zinc can have a potent immunomodulatory effect via the
      modulation of cytokine signalling and AICD, however this effect depends on
      the function and the activation status of the T cells.

TI  - [Effects of Yisui Jiedu Recipe on JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction pathway
      in bone marrow hematopoietic cells from patients with myelodysplastic
      syndrome-refractory anemia]
PG  - 185-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Yisui Jiedu Recipe (YSJDR), a
      compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on cytokines and their
      corresponding just another kinase 2-signal transducers and activators of
      transcription 5 (JAK2-STAT5) signal transduction pathway in bone marrow
      hematopoietic cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory
      anemia (MDS-RA). METHODS: Fluorogenic quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction (FQ-PCR) method was established to detect the levels of JAK2,
      STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNA expressions, and JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction
      pathway was activated by granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF) in cultured bone marrow hematopoietic cells from 10 patients with
      MDS-RA. The levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-3 (IL-3),
      gamma-interferon (gamma-INF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)
      in the cultural supernatant of untreated control, AG490-treated and
      YSJDF-treated cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      RESULTS: The levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha in YSJDR-treated group were
      significantly lower than those in untreated control group and
      AG490-treated group (P<0.01, P<0.05), and IL-3 level in YSJDP-treated
      group was remarkably higher than that in the other two groups (P<0.01).
      There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-2 and IL-3
      between AG490-treated group and untreated control group (P>0.05), while
      the TNF-alpha level in AG490-treated group was decreased obviously as
      compared with the untreated control group (P<0.01). There was no
      significant difference in gamma-INF level between YSJDR-treated group and
      AG490-treated group (P>0.05), while TNF-alpha level in the two groups were
      significantly lower than that in the untreated control group (P<0.01). The
      expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNAs were significantly
      down-regulated in the YSJDR-treated and the AG490-treated groups as
      compared with those in the untreated control group (P<0.05, P<0.01), while
      there were no differences in the expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL
      mRNAs between YSJDR-treated group and AG490-treated group. CONCLUSION:
      YSJDR can modulate cytokine level in bone marrow hematopoietic cells of
      MDS-RA, suppress JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction, and inhibit the Bcl-xL
      mRNA expression.

TI  - IL-2 activation of STAT5 enhances production of IL-10 from human cytotoxic
      regulatory T cells, HOZOT.
PG  - 181-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL)-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine produced
      by many cell types, including T cells. We previously reported that a novel
      type of regulatory T (Treg) cells, termed HOZOT, which possesses a
      FOXP3+CD4+CD8+CD25+ phenotype and dual suppressor/cytotoxic activities,
      produced high levels of IL-10. In this study, we examined the mechanisms
      of high IL-10 production by HOZOT, focusing on Janus activating kinase
      (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling
      pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prepared five different types of T
      cells, including HOZOT from human umbilical cord blood. Cytokine
      productions of IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were compared among these T cells after
      anti-CD3/CD28 antibody stimulation in the presence or absence of IL-2.
      Specific inhibitors for JAK/STAT, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and
      nuclear factor for activated T cell (NFAT) were used to analyze signal
      transduction mechanisms. RESULTS: IL-10 production by HOZOTs was greatly
      enhanced by the addition of IL-2. Little or no enhancement of IFN-gamma
      and TNF-alpha production was observed under the same conditions. The
      enhancing effect of IL-2 was specific for both HOZOT and IL-10-secreting
      Treg cells. T helper type 2 cells, whose IL-10 production mechanisms
      involve GATA-3, failed to show IL-2-mediated enhancement of IL-10. Similar
      enhancing effects of IL-15 and IFN-alpha suggested a major role of
      JAK/STAT activation pathway for high IL-10 production. Further inhibitor
      experiments demonstrated that STAT5 rather than STAT3 was critically
      involved in this mechanism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that IL-2
      selectively enhanced production of IL-10 in HOZOT primarily through
      activation of STAT5, which synergistically acts with NF-kappaB/NFAT
      activation, implying a novel regulatory mechanism of IL-10 production in
      Treg cells.

TI  - Ets-1 is a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation.
PG  - 2825-35
AB  - IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a role in the clearance of
      extracellular bacteria and contributes to the pathology of many autoimmune
      and allergic conditions. IL-17 is produced mainly by a newly characterized
      subset of T helper (Th) cells termed Th17. Although the role of Th17 cells
      in the pathology of autoimmune diseases is well established, the
      transcription factors regulating the differentiation of Th17 cells remain
      poorly characterized. We report that Ets-1-deficient Th cells
      differentiated more efficiently to Th17 cells than wild-type cells. This
      was attributed to both low IL-2 production and increased resistance to the
      inhibitory effect of IL-2 on Th17 differentiation. The resistance to IL-2
      suppression was caused by a defect downstream of STAT5 phosphorylation,
      but was not caused by a difference in the level of RORgamma t.
      Furthermore, Ets-1-deficient mice contained an abnormally high level of
      IL-17 transcripts in their lungs and exhibited increased mucus production
      by airway epithelial cells in an IL-17-dependent manner. Based on these
      observations, we report that Ets-1 is a negative regulator of Th17
      differentiation.

TI  - Retinoic acid inhibits Th17 polarization and enhances FoxP3 expression
      through a Stat-3/Stat-5 independent signaling pathway.
PG  - 1013-20
AB  - CD4(+) helper T (Th) cells play a crucial role in the delicate balance
      between host defense and autoimmune disease. Two important populations of
      helper T cells are the proinflammatory, interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing
      (Th17) cells and the anti-inflammatory forkhead box P3-positive (FoxP3(+))
      T regulatory (Treg) cells. Here we show that all-trans retinoic acid
      (ATRA) and other agonists of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha)
      inhibit the formation of Th17 cells and promote FoxP3 expression.
      Conversely, inhibition of retinoic acid signaling constrains transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) induction of FoxP3. The effect of ATRA is
      mediated independently of IL-2, signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 5 (Stat5) and Stat3, representing a novel mechanism for the
      induction of FoxP3 in CD4 T cells. As previous studies have shown that
      vitamin A derivatives are protective in animal models of autoimmune
      disease, the current data suggest a previously unrecognized role for
      RARalpha in the regulation of CD4(+) T-cell differentiation and provide a
      mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of retinoic acid.

TI  - Cutting edge: Modulation of intestinal autoimmunity and IL-2 signaling by
      sphingosine kinase 2 independent of sphingosine 1-phosphate.
PG  - 5644-8
AB  - Sphingosine kinase (Sphk) phosphorylates sphingosine into
      sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), but its recently identified isoform Sphk2
      has been suggested to have distinct subcellular localization and substrate
      specificity. We demonstrate here that, surprisingly, Sphk2(-/-) CD4(+) T
      cells exhibit a hyperactivated phenotype with significantly enhanced
      proliferation and cytokine secretion in response to IL-2 as well as
      reduced sensitivity to regulatory T cell-mediated suppression in vitro,
      apparently independent of effects upon S1P. Such findings appear to
      reflect a requirement for Sphk2 to suppress IL-2 signaling because, in
      Sphk2(-/-) CD4(+) T cells, IL-2 induced abnormally accentuated STAT5
      phosphorylation and small interfering RNA knockdown of STAT5 abrogated
      their hyperactive phenotype. This pathway physiologically modulates
      autoinflammatory responses, because Sphk2(-/-) T cells induced more rapid
      and robust inflammatory bowel disease in scid recipients. Thus, Sphk2
      regulates IL-2 pathways in T cells, and the modulation of Sphk2 activity
      may be of therapeutic utility in inflammatory and/or infectious diseases.

TI  - The opposite effects of IL-15 and IL-21 on CLL B cells correlate with
      differential activation of the JAK/STAT and ERK1/2 pathways.
PG  - 517-24
AB  - The clonal expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells requires
      the interaction with the microenvironment and is under the control of
      several cytokines. Here, we investigated the effect of IL-15 and IL-21,
      which are closely related to IL-2 and share the usage of the common gamma
      chain and of its JAK3-associated pathway. We found remarkable differences
      in the signal transduction pathways activated by these cytokines, which
      determined different responses in CLL cells. IL-15 caused cell
      proliferation and prevented apoptosis induced by surface IgM
      cross-linking. These effects were more evident in cells stimulated via
      surface CD40, which exhibited increased cell expression of IL-15Ralpha
      chain and, in some of the cases, also of IL-2Rbeta. IL-21 failed to induce
      CLL cell proliferation and instead promoted apoptosis. Following cell
      exposure to IL-15, phosphorylation of STAT5 was predominantly observed,
      whereas, following stimulation with IL-21, there was predominant STAT1 and
      STAT3 activation. Moreover, IL-15 but not IL-21 caused an increased
      phosphorylation of Shc and ERK1/2. Pharmacological inhibition of JAK3 or
      of MEK, which phosphorylates ERK1/2, efficiently blocked IL-15-induced CLL
      cell proliferation and the antiapoptotic effect of this cytokine. The
      knowledge of the signaling pathways regulating CLL cell survival and
      proliferation may provide new molecular targets for therapeutic
      intervention.

TI  - Altered phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription
      profile of CD4+CD161+ T cells in asthma: modulation by allergic status and
      oral corticosteroids.
PG  - 1441-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is a complex immunologic disorder linked to altered
      cytokine signaling. OBJECTIVE: We tested whether asthmatic patients showed
      any change in cytokine-dependent signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) levels, focusing on the central/effector-memory
      CD4(+)CD161(+) subset, which represents 15% to 25% of circulating T cells.
      METHODS: We quantified intracellular levels of active phosphorylated STAT
      (phospho-STAT) 1, 3, 5, and 6 by means of flow cytometry, without any
      activation or expansion. RESULTS: Baseline phospho-STAT1 and phospho-STAT6
      levels were increased in CD4(+)CD161(+) T cells from asthmatic patients
      compared with those from healthy control subjects (by 10- and 8-fold,
      respectively). This asthma-associated alteration was both subset specific
      because no change was seen in CD4(+)CD161(-)CD25(+) (regulatory T cells)
      and CD4(+)CD161(-)CD25(-) subsets and isoform specific because
      phospho-STAT5 and phospho-STAT3 levels were unchanged. Among asthmatic
      patients, phospho-STAT1 and phospho-STAT6 levels correlated negatively
      with each other, suggesting antagonistic regulation. Oral corticosteroid
      (OCS) treatment significantly decreased phospho-STAT6 and IL-4 levels but
      not phospho-STAT1 levels. Disease parameters showing significant
      correlations with phospho-STAT1, phospho-STAT6, or both included age at
      onset, plasma IgE levels, and levels of the T(H)2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10
      and the T(H)1 cytokine IL-2. Overall, combined phospho-STAT1 and
      phospho-STAT6 measurements showed excellent predictive value for
      identifying (1) asthmatic patients versus healthy control subjects, (2)
      allergic versus nonallergic asthmatic patients, and (3) asthmatic patients
      taking versus those not taking OCSs. CONCLUSION: Baseline changes in
      phospho-STAT1 and phospho-STAT6 levels in blood CD4(+)CD161(+) T cells
      identify asthmatic patients and mirror their allergic status and response
      to OCSs. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These results confirm the pathologic
      importance of activated STAT1 and STAT6 in asthma and suggest their
      potential use as clinical biomarkers.

TI  - STAT5 is essential for Akt/p70S6 kinase activity during IL-2-induced
      lymphocyte proliferation.
PG  - 5301-8
AB  - IL-2R activates two distinct signaling pathways mediated by the adaptor
      protein Shc and the transcription factor STAT5. Prior mutagenesis studies
      of the IL-2R have indicated that the Shc and STAT5 pathways are redundant
      in the ability to induce lymphocyte proliferation. Yet paradoxically, T
      cells from STAT5-deficient mice fail to proliferate in response to IL-2,
      suggesting that the Shc pathway is unable to promote mitogenesis in the
      genetic absence of STAT5. Here we show in the murine lymphocyte cell line
      Ba/F3 that low levels of STAT5 activity are essential for Shc signaling.
      In the absence of STAT5 activity, Shc was unable to sustain activation of
      the Akt/p70S6 kinase pathway or promote lymphocyte proliferation and
      viability. Restoring STAT5 activity via a heterologous receptor rescued
      Shc-induced Akt/p70S6 kinase activity and cell proliferation with kinetics
      consistent with a transcriptional mechanism. Thus, STAT5 appears to
      regulate the expression of one or more unidentified components of the Akt
      pathway. Our results not only explain the severe proliferative defect in
      STAT5-deficient T cells but also provide mechanistic insight into the
      oncogenic properties of STAT5 in various leukemias and lymphomas.

TI  - Interleukin-21 differentially affects human natural killer cell subsets.
PG  - 486-95
AB  - Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects on various
      cell types including dendritic cells, B cells, T cells and natural killer
      (NK) cells. To evaluate if IL-21 affects human NK cell subpopulations in a
      similar fashion, functional studies were performed on CD56(dim) and
      CD56(bright) NK cells, both bearing IL-21 receptors at identical
      densities. Stimulation with IL-21 strongly induced proliferation of
      CD56(bright) NK cells and cytotoxicity against K562 target cells was
      preferentially augmented in CD56(dim) NK cells. In contrast, stimulation
      with IL-2 and IL-21 alone or in combination failed to induce
      interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production in the two NK
      cell subsets. Intracellular analysis of signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) proteins revealed that IL-21 by itself induces
      phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in CD56(dim) NK cells, and to an even
      higher degree in CD56(bright) NK cells. In this CD56(bright) NK cell
      population alone, IL-2 weakly phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3, which was
      further increased when cells were treated with the combination of both
      cytokines. In contrast, STAT5 was strongly phosphorylated only in
      CD56(bright) NK cells by low-dose IL-2, while IL-21 did not affect STAT5
      at all. In summary, we present data indicating that the NK-cell-directed
      cytokines IL-2 and IL-21 not only affect functions in NK cell
      subpopulations differently but can also act additively.

TI  - Regulation of interleukin-2 signaling by fatty acids in human lymphocytes.
PG  - 2009-19
AB  - Docosahexaenoic (DHA; C22:6 n-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA; C20:5 n-3),
      palmitic (PA; C16:0), and stearic (SA; C18:0) acids decrease lymphocyte
      proliferation in concentrations of >50 muM, as observed in our previous
      study. However, oleic acid (OA; C18:1 n-9) and linoleic acid (LA; C18:2
      n-6) increase lymphocyte proliferation at 25 muM. In this study, the
      effect of these FAs on the interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling pathway in human
      lymphocytes was investigated. Cells were isolated from heparinized venous
      blood of healthy human donors by density-gradient sedimentation. Cells
      were stimulated with 5 mug/ml concanavalin A and treated with FAs in the
      absence or presence of IL-2 for 1 hour. CD25-alpha externalization was
      analyzed by flow cytometry, and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK3, signal
      transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5, extracellular
      signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2, Akt, and protein kinase C
      (PKC)-zeta phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blotting. The
      expression of CD25-alpha at the cell surface was increased by DHA, SA, and
      PA but was unaffected by EPA, OA, and LA. PA, SA, DHA, and EPA decreased
      JAK1, JAK3, STAT5, and Akt phosphorylation induced by IL-2, but OA and LA
      did not cause any effect. OA and LA increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
      whereas the other FAs caused a marked decrease. PKC-zeta phosphorylation
      was decreased by OA and LA and was not altered by the remaining FAs. In
      conclusion, the inhibitory effect of PA, SA, DHA, and EPA on lymphocyte
      proliferation observed in our previous study was attributable to a
      decrease in JAK/STAT, ERK, and Akt pathways activated by IL-2. Probably,
      OA and LA stimulated lymphocyte proliferation by increasing ERK1/2
      phosphorylation through PKC-zeta activation. The inhibition of JAK1, JAK3,
      STAT5, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation caused by DHA, SA, and PA is
      associated with an alteration of CD25 expression at the cell surface.

TI  - Interaction of TNF with TNF receptor type 2 promotes expansion and
      function of mouse CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells.
PG  - 154-61
AB  - Although TNF is a major proinflammatory cytokine, increasing evidence
      indicates that TNF also has immunosuppressive feedback effects. We have
      demonstrated in this study that, in both resting and activated states,
      mouse peripheral CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) expressed
      remarkably higher surface levels of TNFR2 than CD4(+)CD25(-) T effector
      cells (Teffs). In cocultures of Tregs and Teffs, inhibition of
      proliferation of Teffs by Tregs was initially transiently abrogated by
      exposure to TNF, but longer exposure to TNF restored suppressive effects.
      Cytokine production by Teffs remained continually suppressed by Tregs. The
      profound anergy of Tregs in response to TCR stimulation was overcome by
      TNF, which expanded the Treg population. Furthermore, in synergy with
      IL-2, TNF expanded Tregs even more markedly up-regulated expression of
      CD25 and FoxP3 and phosphorylation of STAT5, and enhanced the suppressive
      activity of Tregs. Unlike TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 did not up-regulate
      FoxP3-expressing Tregs. Furthermore, the number of Tregs increased in
      wild-type mice, but not in TNFR2(-/-) mice following sublethal cecal
      ligation and puncture. Depletion of Tregs significantly decreased
      mortality following cecal ligation and puncture. Thus, the stimulatory
      effect of TNF on Tregs resembles the reported costimulatory effects of TNF
      on Teffs, but is even more pronounced because of the higher expression of
      TNFR2 by Tregs. Moreover, our study suggests that the slower response of
      Tregs than Teffs to TNF results in delayed immunosuppressive feedback
      effects.

TI  - Curcumin reverses breast tumor exosomes mediated immune suppression of NK
      cell tumor cytotoxicity.
PG  - 1116-23
AB  - An important characteristic of tumors is that they at some point in their
      development overcome the surveillance of the immune system. Tumors secrete
      exosomes, multivesicular bodies containing a distinct set of proteins that
      can fuse with cells of the circulating immune system. Purified exosomes
      from TS/A breast cancer cells, but not non-exosomal fractions, inhibit (at
      concentrations of nanograms per ml protein) IL-2-induced natural killer
      (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The dietary polyphenol, curcumin
      (diferuloylmethane), partially reverses tumor exosome-mediated inhibition
      of natural killer cell activation, which is mediated through the
      impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Exposure of mouse breast
      tumor cells to curcumin causes a dose-dependent increase in ubiquitinated
      exosomal proteins compared to those in untreated TS/A breast tumor cells.
      Furthermore, exosomes isolated from tumor cells pretreated with curcumin
      have a much attenuated inhibition of IL-2 stimulated NK cell activation.
      Jak3-mediated activation of Stat5 is required for tumor cytotoxicity of
      IL-2 stimulated NK cells. TS/A tumor exosomes strongly inhibit activation
      of Stat5, whereas the tumor exosomes isolated from curcumin-pretreated
      tumor cells have a lowered potency for inhibition of IL-2 stimulated NK
      cell cytotoxicity. These data suggest that partial reversal of tumor
      exosome-mediated inhibition of NK cell tumor cytotoxicity may account for
      the anti-cancer properties of curcumin.

TI  - Reduced numbers of IL-7 receptor (CD127) expressing immune cells and
      IL-7-signaling defects in peripheral blood from patients with breast
      cancer.
PG  - 1512-9
AB  - Interleukin-7-receptor-signaling plays a pivotal role in T-cell
      development and maintenance of T-cell memory. We studied IL-7Ralpha
      (CD127) expression in PBMCs obtained from patients with breast cancer and
      examined IL-7 receptor-mediated downstream effects defined by STAT5
      phosphorylation (p-STAT5). Reduced numbers of IL-7Ralpha-positive cells
      were identified in CD4+ T-cells as well as in a CD8+ T-cell subset defined
      by CD8alpha/alpha homodimer expression in patients with breast cancer.
      PBMCs obtained from healthy donors (n = 19) and from patients with breast
      cancer (n = 19) exhibited constitutive p-STAT5 expression in the range of
      0-6.4% in CD4+ T-cells and 0-4% in CD8+ T-cells. Stimulation with
      recombinant human IL-7 for 15 min increased p-STAT5 expression up to
      36-97% in CD4+T-cells and to 26-90% in CD8+T-cells obtained from healthy
      control donors (n = 19). In contrast, PBMCs obtained from 13/19 patients
      with breast cancer did not respond to IL-7 as defined by STAT5
      phosphorylation, despite expression of IL-7Ralpha on T-lymphocytes.
      T-cells were further characterized for IL- 2 and IFN-gamma production
      induced by PMA/Ionomycin. PBMCs from 9/19 patients with breast cancer
      showed decreased IL-2 and IFN-gamma production combined with
      IL-7-signaling defects; PBMCs from 4 patients with breast cancer exhibited
      deficient IL-7-signaling, yet intact cytokine production. Reduced numbers
      of IL-7Ralpha-positive cells and nonresponsiveness to IL-7, defined by
      lack of STAT5 phosphorylation, characterizes the immunological profile in
      T-cells from patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Temporal regulation of Stat5 activity in determination of cell
      differentiation program.
PG  - 914-9
AB  - Although Stat5 is activated by various cytokines, only erythropoietin
      (Epo) and a small number of cytokines induce Stat5-dependent erythroid
      differentiation. Here, by using a reporter gene system to monitor
      transcriptional activity of Stat5, we showed that Epo but not interleukin
      (IL)-3 supports sustained activation of Stat5, which induces globin gene
      expression. IL-3 or IL-2 stimulation inhibits Epo-induced globin gene
      expression. The acidic region of the IL-2 receptor beta-chain was
      essential for this inhibition. These results underscore the importance of
      temporal regulation of Stat activity for regulation of cytokine-specific
      cell differentiation.

TI  - Interleukin-2 signaling via STAT5 constrains T helper 17 cell generation.
PG  - 371-81
AB  - Recent work has identified a new subset of effector T cells that produces
      interleukin (IL)-17 known as T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which is involved
      in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and is thought to be
      developmentally related to regulatory T (Treg) cells. Because of its
      importance for Treg cells, we examined the role of IL-2 in Th17 generation
      and demonstrate that a previously unrecognized aspect of IL-2 function is
      to constrain IL-17 production. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of
      IL-2 promoted differentiation of the Th17 cell subset. Whereas STAT3
      appeared to be a key positive regulator of RORgammat and IL-17 expression,
      absence of IL-2 or disruption of its signaling by deletion of the
      transcription factor STAT5 resulted in enhanced Th17 cell development. We
      conclude that in addition to the promotion of activation-induced cell
      death of lymphocytes and the generation of Treg cells, inhibition of Th17
      polarization appears to be an important function of IL-2.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta downregulates interleukin-2-induced
      phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 in
      human renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 487-92
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated signal transducer and activator of
      transcription-5 (STAT5) activation status in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
      and the role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the process.
      METHODS: Twenty normal and RCC tissues were obtained from radical
      nephrectomy specimens for the assessment of expressions of phosphorylated
      STAT5 (p-STAT5) and TGF-beta1 (Western blot) and for localization and
      assessment of their relationship (immunohistochemical and
      immunofluorescence stains). By using four RCC cell lines and four primary
      cultured cells, the effect of TGF-beta1 and/or interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the
      expressions of p-STAT5 were analyzed. RESULTS: In RCC samples, expression
      of p-STAT5 was significantly reduced while expression of TGF-beta was
      enhanced compared with normal kidney tissues (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003,
      respectively). P-STAT5 was observed almost exclusively in the nuclei of
      normal kidney tissues while TGF-beta was identified in the cytoplasm of
      cells of both tissues reflecting the Western results. In both RCC cell
      lines and cells from primary cultures, treatment with TGF-beta or antibody
      did not significantly alter STAT5 activation. However, TGF-beta
      significantly suppressed IL-2-induced STAT5 activation, whereas
      anti-TGF-beta antibodies enhanced IL-2-induced STAT5 further. CONCLUSIONS:
      STAT5 activation is suppressed in RCC compared with normal renal
      parenchyma. It may be attributed to the RCC-derived TGF-beta which also
      interferes with IL-2-induced STAT5 pathway activation.

TI  - Expansion of spleen myeloid suppressor cells represses NK cell
      cytotoxicity in tumor-bearing host.
PG  - 4336-42
AB  - Tumor growth promotes the expansion of myeloid suppressor cells. An
      inverse correlation between natural killer (NK) cell activation and
      myeloid suppressor cell (MSC) expansion in tumor-bearing patients and mice
      prompted us to investigate the role of MSCs in controlling NK antitumor
      cytotocixity. After adoptive transfer to naive recipients, CD11b(+)Gr-1(+)
      MSCs freshly isolated from spleens of tumor-bearing mice but not naive
      mice were able to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity. An in vivo imaging
      analysis indicates that the removal of tumors resulted in a significant
      increased ability (P < .05) in NK cell cytotoxicity to eliminate injected
      YAC-1 cells from the lungs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)
      analysis of the composition of lung leukocytes further indicates that the
      removal of tumors also leads to the reduction of MSCs accumulated in the
      lung. These data suggest that MSCs suppress NK cell cytotoxicity. The
      inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity is cell-cell contact dependent.
      Inhibition of perforin but not granzyme B production was responsible for
      MSC-mediated inhibition of NK cytotoxicity. Western blot analyses further
      suggests that MSCs suppress IL-2-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity by
      affecting the activity of Stat5.

TI  - Suppression of early IL-4 production underlies the failure of CD4 T cells
      activated by TLR-stimulated dendritic cells to differentiate into Th2
      cells.
PG  - 1635-44
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) activated through TLRs provide a potent negative
      signal for Th2 cell development that is independent of positive signals
      for Th1 cell development such as IL-12 and IFN-gamma. In this study we
      demonstrate that the ability of TLR-activated DCs to suppress Th2 cell
      development is Ag dose-independent and unique to DCs that have been
      activated through TLRs vs by cytokines. We show that TLR-activated DCs
      inhibit early IL-4 production by CD4 T cells and thus inhibit their
      ability to subsequently increase GATA-3 expression and commit to the Th2
      lineage. This occurs independently of expression of the GATA-3 antagonist
      T-bet. Although CD4 T cells activated by TLR-activated DCs make IL-2, they
      are not capable of phosphorylating STAT5 in response to this cytokine.
      This inhibition of responsiveness to IL-2 appears to underlie the failure
      to make early IL-4. Our findings suggest that DCs provide instructional
      signals for T cell differentiation before cytokine-mediated Th cell
      selection and outgrowth.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the methylprednisolone-mediated inhibition of
      NK-cell function: evidence for different susceptibility of IL-2- versus
      IL-15-activated NK cells.
PG  - 3767-75
AB  - Steroids have been shown to inhibit the function of fresh or
      IL-2-activated natural killer (NK) cells. Since IL-15 plays a key role in
      NK-cell development and function, we comparatively analyzed the effects of
      methylprednisolone on IL-2- or IL-15-cultured NK cells. Methylprednisolone
      inhibited the surface expression of the major activating receptors NKp30
      and NKp44 in both conditions, whereas NK-cell proliferation and survival
      were sharply impaired only in IL-2-cultured NK cells. Accordingly,
      methylprednisolone inhibited Tyr phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and
      STAT5 in IL-2-cultured NK cells but only marginally in IL-15-cultured NK
      cells, whereas JAK3 was inhibited under both conditions. Also, the NK
      cytotoxicity was similarly impaired in IL-2- or IL-15-cultured NK cells.
      This effect strictly correlated with the inhibition of ERK1/2 Tyr
      phosphorylation, perforin release, and cytotoxicity in a redirected
      killing assay against the FcRgamma(+) P815 target cells upon cross-linking
      of NKp46, NKG2D, or 2B4 receptors. In contrast, in the case of CD16,
      inhibition of ERK1/2 Tyr phosphorylation, perforin release, and
      cytotoxicity were not impaired. Our study suggests a different ability of
      IL-15-cultured NK cells to survive to steroid treatment, thus offering
      interesting clues for a correct NK-cell cytokine conditioning in adoptive
      immunotherapy.

TI  - The molecular basis of IL-21-mediated proliferation.
PG  - 4135-42
AB  - Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a type I cytokine that modulates functions of T,
      B, natural killer (NK), and myeloid cells. The IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) is
      closely related to the IL-2 receptor beta chain and is capable of
      transducing signals through its dimerization with the common cytokine
      receptor gamma chain (gamma(c)), the protein whose expression is defective
      in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. To clarify the
      molecular basis of IL-21 actions, we investigated the role of tyrosine
      residues in the IL-21R cytoplasmic domain. Simultaneous mutation of all 6
      tyrosines greatly diminished IL-21-mediated proliferation, whereas
      retention of tyrosine 510 (Y510) allowed full proliferation. Y510
      efficiently mediated IL-21-induced phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3, but
      not of Stat5, and CD8(+) T cells from Stat1/Stat3 double knock-out mice
      exhibited decreased proliferation in response to IL-21 + IL-15. In
      addition, IL-21 weakly induced phosphorylation of Shc and Akt, and
      consistent with this, specific inhibitors of the MAPK and PI3K pathways
      inhibited IL-21-mediated proliferation. Collectively, these data indicate
      the involvement of the Jak-STAT, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in IL-21
      signaling.

TI  - Helper T cell IL-2 production is limited by negative feedback and
      STAT-dependent cytokine signals.
PG  - 65-71
AB  - Although required for many fundamental immune processes, ranging from
      self-tolerance to pathogen immunity, interleukin (IL)-2 production is
      transient, and the mechanisms underlying this brevity remain unclear.
      These studies reveal that helper T cell IL-2 production is limited by a
      classic negative feedback loop that functions autonomously or in
      collaboration with other common gamma chain (IL-4 and IL-7) and IL-6/IL-12
      family cytokines (IL-12 and IL-27). Consistent with this model for
      cytokine-dependent regulation, they also demonstrate that the inhibitory
      effect can be mediated by several signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) family transcription factors, namely STAT5, STAT4,
      and STAT6. Collectively, these findings establish that IL-2 production is
      limited by a network of autocrine and paracrine signals that are readily
      available during acute inflammatory responses and, thus, provide a
      cellular and molecular basis for its transient pattern of expression.

TI  - IL-2 receptor beta-dependent STAT5 activation is required for the
      development of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.
PG  - 280-90
AB  - IL-2(-/-) mice develop autoimmunity despite having relatively normal
      numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In contrast, we demonstrate that
      IL-2(-/-) x IL-15(-/-) and IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice have a significant decrease
      in Treg numbers. Ectopic expression of foxp3 in a subset of CD4(+) T cells
      rescued Treg development and prevented autoimmunity in IL-2Rbeta(-/-)
      mice, suggesting that IL-2Rbeta-dependent signals regulate foxp3
      expression in Tregs. Subsequent analysis of IL-2Rbeta-dependent signal
      transduction pathways established that the transcription factor STAT5 is
      necessary and sufficient for Treg development. Specifically, T
      cell-specific deletion of STAT5 prevented Treg development; conversely,
      reconstitution of IL-2Rbeta(-/-) mice with bone marrow cells expressing an
      IL-2Rbeta mutant that exclusively activates STAT5 restored Treg
      development. Finally, STAT5 binds to the promoter of the foxp3 gene
      suggesting that IL-2Rbeta-dependent STAT5 activation promotes Treg
      differentiation by regulating expression of foxp3.

TI  - Immune regulation of T lymphocyte by a newly characterized human umbilical
      cord blood stem cell.
PG  - 78-87
AB  - Previous work identified a novel type of stem cell from human umbilical
      cord blood, designated cord blood-stem cells (CB-SC). To further evaluate
      their immune characteristics, we cocultured CB-SC with allogeneic
      peripheral blood lymphocytes in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)
      or interleukin-2 (IL-2). Results showed that CB-SC could significantly
      inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of
      STAT5 in both PHA- and IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes, along with the
      regulation on the phenotypes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Additionally, CB-SC
      also suppressed the proliferation of IL-2-stimulated CD4+CD25+ regulatory
      T cells. Mechanism studies revealed that programmed death receptor-1
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on CB-SC membrane, together with a soluble
      factor nitric oxide (NO) released by PHA-stimulated CB-SC, not
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1),
      mainly contributed to the T cell suppression induced by CB-SC, as
      demonstrated by blocking experiments with a nitric oxide synthase
      inhibitor (Nomega-nitro-l-arginine, l-NNA) and a neutralizing antibody to
      PD-L1. Our findings may advance our understanding of the immunobiology of
      stem cells and facilitate the therapeutic application of cord blood stem
      cells.

TI  - Upregulation of Foxp3 expression in mouse and human Treg is IL-2/STAT5
      dependent: implications for the NOD STAT5B mutation in diabetes
      pathogenesis.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Treg), characterized as CD4(+)/CD25(+hi) T cells, are
      critical for sustaining and promoting immune tolerance. Treg are highly
      dependent on IL-2 and IL-2 signaling to maintain their numbers and
      function and interruption of this pathway promotes autoimmunity. The
      transcription factor, Foxp3, is also required for Treg function as
      defective Foxp3 promotes autoimmunity in both mice and humans. We
      previously reported a point mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the NOD
      STAT5B gene that limits DNA binding when compared to wild-type STAT5 mice.
      Based on the presence of five STAT5B consensus sequences in the Foxp3
      promotor, we hypothesized a critical linkage between IL-2 signaling/STAT5B
      and Foxp3 expression in Treg. Our data show IL-2 activates long-form (LF)
      STAT5 and sustains Foxp3 expression in Treg. In contrast, CD4(+)/CD25(-) T
      cells do not active LF STAT5 and do not express Foxp3 under the same
      conditions. In addition, blocking LF STAT5 activation with a Jak inhibitor
      (AG-490) significantly reduced Foxp3 expression in Treg. Examination of
      human Treg using flow cytometry and intracellular staining for Foxp3
      expression likewise demonstrates that IL-2 maintains Foxp3 expression
      through LF STAT5 signaling. These studies reveal a critical link between
      IL-2 mediated JAK-STAT5 signaling and the maintenance of Foxp3 expression
      in Treg of mice and humans.

TI  - Gfi-1 plays an important role in IL-2-mediated Th2 cell expansion.
PG  - 18214-9
AB  - Enforced expression of growth factor independent 1 (Gfi-1), a
      transcription repressor induced by T cell activation and IL-4/Stat6
      signaling, strikingly enhances Th2 cell expansion. Using conditionally
      Gfi1-deficient mice prepared for this study, we show that in vitro or in
      vivo deletion of this factor dramatically reduces Th2, but not Th1, cell
      expansion in response to IL-2. Both increased cell apoptosis and reduced
      cell proliferation resulted from Gfi1 deletion. IL-2-Stat5 signaling was
      partially reduced in Gfi1-deficient Th2 cells, but overexpression of Stat5
      failed to restore normal Th2 expansion in these cells, suggesting that
      Gfi-1 also functioned downstream of, or in parallel with, Stat5 signaling.
      Reduced Th2 cell expansion in the absence of Gfi-1 was confirmed by the
      diminished frequency of IL-4-producing cells when these mice were infected
      with Schistosoma mansoni.

TI  - Genetic background influences Th cell differentiation by controlling the
      capacity for IL-2-induced IL-4 production by naive CD4+ T cells.
PG  - 1681-90
AB  - Comparative studies using T(h)2-prone BALB/c and T(h)1-prone C57BL/6 mice
      were performed to clarify the influence of genetic background on T(h) cell
      differentiation. The results showed IL-4, the production of which is
      induced by IL-2, to be much more abundantly produced by BALB/c naive
      CD4(+) T cells than by C57BL/6 naive CD4(+) T cells, thereby leading to a
      tendency for differentiation toward T(h)2 in BALB/c naive CD4(+) T cells.
      This difference in IL-4 production between the two naive CD4(+) T cells
      appeared to be attributable to specific intracellular signaling events.
      Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was
      preferentially activated by IL-2 in CD4(+) T cells developing in BALB/c in
      contrast to the corresponding cells in C57BL/6. In addition, IL-4 also
      induced stronger STAT5 activation in CD4(+) T cells developing in BALB/c
      than in those developing in C57BL/6, whereas STAT6 was equally activated
      in these two cells. Further results supported the involvement of STAT5 in
      the difference in T(h) cell differentiation between BALB/c and C57BL/6
      naive CD4(+) T cells. STAT5A(-)(/)(-) naive CD4(+) T cells with the BALB/c
      genetic background showed markedly less IL-2-induced IL-4 production than
      BALB/c naive CD4(+) T cells. Conversely, forced expression of the
      constitutively active forms of STAT5A and STAT5B in C57BL/6 naive CD4(+) T
      cells promoted the differentiation of T(h)2 cells. Thus, our results
      indicate IL-2-induced IL-4 production by naive CD4(+) T cells, in which
      STAT5 activation is involved and directly controlled by the genetic
      background, to influence T(h) cell differentiation in murine strains.

      METHODS: Frozen tissue sections of the axillary tumour were examined using
      a laser-assisted microdissection technique and reverse transcriptase
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The novel fusion of exon 8 of EWS and
      the defective exon 10 of WT1 (-KTS) was detected. Although it was an
      unusual form, the coexpression of the present EWS-WT1, IL-2/15Rbeta and
      Janus kinase (JAK1) mRNA was detected in the tumour cells. IL-2 and signal
      transducers and activators of transcription (STAT5) mRNA were detected in
      both tumour and stromal cells. CONCLUSION: The induction of the IL-2/15
      receptor signalling pathway may contribute to tumorigenesis in DSRCT
      through a paracrine or an autocrine system, even though the EWS-WT1 was an
      unusual form.

TI  - Multiparametric flow cytometric analysis of signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 5 phosphorylation in immune cell subsets in
      vitro and following interleukin-2 immunotherapy.
PG  - 5850-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Treatment with interleukin (IL)-2 (Proleukin) yields a 10% to 20%
      response rate in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma. IL-2 is known to activate distinct signals within
      lymphocytes, including the Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer and
      activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. We examined the phosphorylation
      of STAT5 (P-STAT5) in IL-2-stimulated immune cells of normal subjects and
      in patients receiving IL-2 therapy using a novel flow cytometric assay to
      characterize the pattern and level of activation within immune subsets.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
      treated in vitro with IL-2 and analyzed for P-STAT5 using an intracellular
      flow cytometric assay. PBMC were simultaneously evaluated for the
      induction of STAT5-regulated genes at the transcript level. PBMC were also
      obtained from patients immediately before and 1 hour after treatment with
      high-dose IL-2 and analyzed for the presence of P-STAT5 within immune cell
      subsets by dual-variable intracellular flow cytometry. RESULTS: In vitro
      IL-2 treatment produced a rapid and dose-dependent increase in P-STAT5
      within normal PBMC that correlated with the induction of transcript for
      the IL-2-responsive genes CIS, Pim-1, and SOCS1 (correlation coefficients
      0.8628, 0.6667, and 0.7828, respectively). Dose-dependent induction of
      P-STAT5 was detected in PBMC for up to 18 hours following in vitro pulse
      stimulation with IL-2. P-STAT5 was detected within a subset of normal
      donor CD4(+) T cells (52.2 +/- 15.0%), CD8(+) T cells (57.6 +/- 25.8%),
      and CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cells (54.2 +/- 27.2%), but not CD14(+)
      monocytes or CD21(+) B cells, following in vitro IL-2 treatment. The
      generation of P-STAT5 within immune cell subsets after the therapeutic
      administration of IL-2 varied significantly between individuals. NK cells
      were noticeably absent in the posttreatment sample, a finding that was
      consistent for all patients examined. Surprisingly, activated STAT5
      persisted within CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, as well as CD56(+) NK
      cells, for up to 3 weeks post-IL-2 treatment in three patients who
      exhibited a clinical response to therapy and in a fourth who exhibited a
      significant inflammatory response after 11 doses of therapy (first cycle).
      CONCLUSIONS: The flow cytometric assay described herein is a highly
      efficient and reliable method by which to assess the cellular response to
      IL-2 within PBMC and specific immune effector subsets, both in vitro and
      in the clinical setting. Assessment of P-STAT5 in patient PBMC in response
      to therapeutic IL-2 administration reveals disparate responses between
      immune cell subsets as well as interpatient variation. Persistent
      activation of STAT5 within NK and T cells was an unexpected observation
      and requires further investigation.

TI  - A preferential role for STAT5, not constitutively active STAT3, in
      promoting survival of a human lymphoid tumor.
PG  - 5032-40
AB  - STATs are believed to play key roles in normal and abnormal cell function.
      In the present work, we investigated the role of STATs in an
      IL-2-responsive human lymphoblastic lymphoma-derived cell line, YT. Only
      STAT3 was found constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated, but not other
      STATs. Hyperactive STAT3 was not attributable to a pre-existing
      intermediate affinity IL-2R complex and/or hyperactive Jak activity.
      Depletion of STAT3 protein expression reduced tumor cell viability with
      protracted kinetics (72-96 h), while TUNEL assays demonstrated cell death
      occurred via apoptosis. Interestingly, depletion of STAT5 in this same
      tumor induced more pronounced cell death compared with STAT3 depletion (24
      h). Although IL-2 was able to rescue STAT3-depleted cells from death, it
      could not compensate for the loss of STAT5. To determine the prosurvival
      function of STAT3 vs STAT5 within the same tumor model, genes were
      profiled in STAT3- or STAT5-depleted YT cells by apoptosis-specific
      microarrays. Several differentially expressed genes were identified.
      Interestingly, those genes involved in NF-kappaB regulation, such as
      TNFR-associated factors 2 and 5 and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 10, were
      readily decreased upon STAT5, but not STAT3, depletion as validated by
      quantitative RT-PCR. These results suggest that STAT5 and, to a lesser
      extent, hyperactive STAT3 provide preferential and critical cell survival
      signals for certain human lymphoid tumors, indicating that nonhyperactive
      STATs should be considered as therapeutic targets for abrogating
      tumorigenesis.

TI  - Cutting edge: Paracrine, but not autocrine, IL-2 signaling is sustained
      during early antiviral CD4 T cell response.
PG  - 4257-61
AB  - IL-2 is expressed predominantly by activated T cells, and regulates T cell
      function by activating, via its receptor, the latent transcription factor
      STAT5. This signaling can occur in either a paracrine (between cells) or
      an autocrine (same cell) manner, although the kinetics by which these two
      signaling modes operate during in vivo T cell responses are unknown. In
      the current study, IL-2 expression and signaling in a clonotypic
      population of antiviral CD4+ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry during
      the initial 24 h of priming. IL-2 expression and STAT5 activation peaked
      in parallel, but surprisingly, were almost completely mutually exclusive.
      Thus, only paracrine IL-2 signaling could be observed. As an additional
      indication of the efficiency of paracrine IL-2 signaling, polyclonal
      CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells displayed detectable STAT5 activation
      under steady-state conditions, which was strongly enhanced by neighboring
      IL-2-expressing antiviral CD4 cells.

TI  - Interleukin-4 supports interleukin-12-induced proliferation and
      interferon-gamma secretion in human activated lymphoblasts and T helper
      type 1 cells.
PG  - 43-53
AB  - Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-4 are known to differentially promote T
      helper (Th) cell differentiation. While IL-12 induces interferon-gamma
      (IFN-gamma) production and maturation of Th1 cells, IL-4 is thought to
      antagonize IL-12 and to favour Th2 development. Here we studied the
      combined action of various concentrations of common gamma-chain
      (gamma(c)-chain) cytokines, including IL-4 and the Th1 cytokine IL-12, in
      human activated lymphoblasts and Th1 cells. IL-4 and IL-7 potentiated
      IL-12-induced proliferation at every concentration tested (1-10 ng/ml)
      without increasing rescue from apoptosis, indicating that proliferation
      was directly affected by these cytokine combinations. With regards to
      cytokine secretion, IL-2 together with IL-12 initiated tumour necrosis
      factor-alpha synthesis, enhanced IFN-gamma production, and shedding of
      soluble IL-2 receptor alpha as expected. Importantly, combining IL-4 with
      IL-12 also enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in lymphoblasts and a Th1 cell
      line. Investigating signal transduction in lymphoblasts induced by these
      cytokines, we found that not only IL-2 but also IL-4 enhances signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) tyrosine
      phosphorylation by IL-12. Tyrosine phosphorylations of janus kinase 2
      (JAK-2), tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase
      (ERK) and STAT4, STAT5 and STAT6 were not potentiated by combinations of
      these cytokines, suggesting specificity for increased STAT3
      phosphorylation. In conclusion, two otherwise antagonizing cytokines
      co-operate in activated human lymphoblasts and Th1 cells, possibly via
      STAT3 as a converging signal. These data demonstrate that IL-4 can
      directly enhance human Th1 cell function independently of its known
      actions on antigen-presenting cells. These findings should be of
      importance for the design of cytokine-targeted therapies of human
      Th-cell-driven diseases.

TI  - A role for STAT5A/B in protection of peripheral T-lymphocytes from
      postactivation apoptosis: insights from gene expression profiling.
PG  - 143-54
AB  - Activation of the transcription factors STAT5A and STAT5B by JAK1 and JAK3
      tyrosine kinases is a key event in downstream signaling of gammac (common
      gamma chain)-family cytokine receptors in lymphoid cells.
      STAT5A/B-deficiency in mice causes, among other consequences, a reduced
      size and altered composition of the peripheral T-cell pool with
      predominance of an activated or memory-like population
      (CD4(+)/CD44(high)/CD62L(low)) and a proliferative deficiency following
      antigenic stimulation and subsequent IL-2 treatment. To further elucidate
      the critical function of STAT5A/B in homeostasis and activation of murine
      naive peripheral T-lymphocytes, we have analyzed global gene expression of
      STAT5A/B-deficient versus wild-type splenic T-cells by profiling with
      high-density oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix). Comparison of (1) basal
      gene expression of untreated peripheral STAT5A/B-deficient and control
      T-cells and (2) immediate early gene induction upon in vitro stimulation
      of either population with IL-2 has revealed differential expression of a
      broad range of genes potentially contributing to the defects of STAT5A/B
      deficient T-cells. In the context of enhanced apoptotic rates of
      STAT5A/B(-/-)-T-cells in vivo and upon TCR-stimulation in culture our data
      suggest a role for STAT5 in post-activation survival beyond regulation of
      antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and hence provide new insights into the
      nature of the late proliferative block in the T-cell compartment caused by
      STAT5-deficiency.

TI  - Persistent antigenic stimulation alters the transcription program in T
      cells, resulting in antigen-specific tolerance.
PG  - 1374-85
AB  - Repetitive antigen stimulation induces peripheral T cell tolerance in
      vivo. It is not known, however, whether multiple stimulations merely
      suppress T cell activation or, alternatively, change the transcriptional
      program to a distinct, tolerant state. In this study, we have discovered
      that STAT3 and STAT5 were activated in response to antigen stimulation in
      vivo, in marked contrast to the suppression of AP-1, NF-kappaB and NFAT.
      In addition, a number of transcription factors were induced in tolerant T
      cells following antigen challenge in vivo, including T-bet, Irf-1 and
      Egr-2. The altered transcription program in tolerant cells associates
      closely with the suppression of cell cycle progression and IL-2
      production, as well as with the induction of IL-10. Studies of T-bet and
      Egr-2 show that the function of T-bet in peptide treatment-induced
      regulatory T cells is not associated with Th1 differentiation, but
      correlates with the suppression of IL-2, whereas expression of Egr-2 led
      to an up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p21(cip1) and p27(kip).
      Our results demonstrate a balanced transcription program regulated by
      different transcription factors for T cell activation and/or tolerance
      during antigen-induced T cell responses. Persistent antigen stimulation
      can induce T cell tolerance by changing the balance of transcription
      factors.

TI  - Defective cell cycle induction by IL-2 in naive T-cells antigen stimulated
      in the presence of refractory T-lymphocytes.
PG  - 1043-54
AB  - CD4+ T cells enter a transient refractory period after stimulation. Upon
      re-stimulation the refractory cells produce little IL-2 and show
      diminished proliferation. We previously demonstrated that refractory T
      cells can also, like anergic and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, suppress in
      trans the proliferation of antigen-stimulated naive T cells. The
      suppressed T cells up-regulate high-affinity IL-2R but do not produce
      IL-2. This IL-2 deficit could potentially explain the proliferation
      failure, but does not appear to do so. Supplementation of refractory-naive
      co-cultures with exogenous IL-2 fails to alleviate both the proliferation
      suppression and IL-2 production defects. This does not result from a
      failure of IL-2 to stimulate its receptor. Proximal IL-2 signaling into
      suppressed T cells through STAT5 and Akt is intact. However, refractory
      cell-co-cultured T cells fail to up-regulate cyclins and c-myc and
      incompletely down-regulate p27kip1 in response to IL-2, and the downstream
      consequences of this signaling are therefore dissociated. IL-2 signaling
      is not fully disabled as IL-2 up-regulates the anti-apoptotic protein
      Bcl-xL to control levels. This up-regulation correlates with enhanced
      survival of refractory cell-co-cultured T cells placed in IL-2 when
      compared with cells cultured without IL-2. Thus, refractory T cells are
      able to suppress naive T-cell proliferative responses in part by blocking
      both IL-2 production and the mitogenic but not anti-apoptotic effects of
      IL-2. These results have implications for how activation-refractory T
      cells may influence nascent immune responses.

TI  - Intracellular expression of MICA in activated CD4 T lymphocytes and
      protection from NK cell-mediated MICA-dependent cytotoxicity.
PG  - 170-82
AB  - MICA is a stress-regulated molecule recognized by the NK cell-activating
      receptor NKG2D. Previously, we demonstrated that MICA is induced on
      activated T cells but regulation by mitogenic cytokines and its biological
      consequences remain unexplored. Here, we show that IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15
      but not TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha induced MICA expression in T lymphocytes
      present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as assessed by
      Western blot. IL-2 effect involved Jak3/STAT5, p38 MAPK, p70(56) kinase,
      Lck/fyn kinases, and NF-kappaB. MICA expression was also observed in Th1
      and Th2 cells. However, surface expression was not detected. T lymphocytes
      present in PBMCs and isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes stimulated with
      phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and ionomycin also induced MICA expression
      as assessed by Western blot, but only low levels were expressed at the
      cell surface. Activated but not resting CD4+ T lymphocytes were lysed by
      IL-15- or IL-2-stimulated NK cells, and susceptibility was increased when
      HLA class I molecules were blocked. Also, cytokine-stimulated NK cells
      produced more IFN-gamma after culture with activated CD4+ T lymphocytes.
      However, the participation of MICA in these responses, if any, was
      marginal. Confocal microscopy revealed that MICA is retained mostly inside
      activated CD4+ T cells. Our results suggest that low surface expression of
      MICA on activated CD4+ T lymphocytes might be a safeguard mechanism to
      protect them from NK cells in an inflammatory, virus-infected, or tumor
      microenvironment, where NK and activated CD4+ T cells are recruited.

TI  - Defective IgG2a/2b class switching in PKC alpha-/- mice.
PG  - 6004-11
AB  - Using model tumor T cell lines, protein kinase C (PKC) alpha has been
      implicated in IL-2 cytokine promoter activation in response to Ag receptor
      stimulation. In this study, for the first time, PKCalpha null mutant mice
      are analyzed and display normal T and B lymphocyte development. Peripheral
      CD3(+) PKCalpha-deficient T cells show unimpaired activation-induced IL-2
      cytokine secretion, surface expression of CD25, CD44, and CD69, as well as
      transactivation of the critical transcription factors NF-AT, NF-kappaB,
      AP-1, and STAT5 in vitro. Nevertheless, CD3/CD28 Ab- and MHC
      alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production are
      severely impaired in PKCalpha(-/-) CD3(+) T cells. Consistently,
      PKCalpha-deficient CD3(+) T cells from OVA-immunized PKCalpha-deficient
      mice exhibit markedly reduced recall proliferation to OVA in in vitro
      cultures. In vivo, PKCalpha-deficient mice give diminished OVA-specific
      IgG2a and IgG2b responses following OVA immunization experiments. In
      contrast, OVA-specific IgM and IgG1 responses and splenic PKCalpha(-/-) B
      cell proliferation are unimpaired. Our genetic data, thus, define PKCalpha
      as the physiological and nonredundant PKC isotype in signaling pathways
      that are necessary for T cell-dependent IFN-gamma production and IgG2a/2b
      Ab responses.

TI  - IL-2 regulates FOXP3 expression in human CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells
      through a STAT-dependent mechanism and induces the expansion of these
      cells in vivo.
PG  - 1571-9
AB  - IL-2 plays a critical role in the maintenance of CD4+CD25+ FOXP3(+)
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo. We examined the effects of IL-2
      signaling in human Tregs. In vitro, IL-2 selectively up-regulated the
      expression of FOXP3 in purified CD4+CD25+ T cells but not in CD4+CD25-
      cells. This regulation involved the binding of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins to
      a highly conserved STAT-binding site located in the first intron of the
      FOXP3 gene. We also examined the effects of low-dose IL-2 treatment in 12
      patients with metastatic cancer and 9 patients with chronic myelogenous
      leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
      Overall, IL-2 treatment resulted in a 1.9 median fold increase in the
      frequency of CD4+CD25+ cells in peripheral blood as well as a 9.7 median
      fold increase in FOXP3 expression in CD3+ T cells. CD56+CD3- natural
      killer (NK) cells also expanded during IL-2 therapy but did not express
      FOXP3. In vitro treatment of NK cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored
      the IL-2 signaling pathway leading to FOXP3 expression, suggesting that
      this gene was constitutively repressed by DNA methylation in these cells.
      Our findings support the clinical evaluation of low-dose IL-2 to
      selectively modulate CD4+CD25+ Tregs and increase expression of FOXP3 in
      vivo.

TI  - STAT5-mediated signals sustain a TCR-initiated gene expression program
      toward differentiation of CD8 T cell effectors.
PG  - 4834-42
AB  - Poorly functional effector CD8 T cells are generated in some pathological
      situations, including responses to weakly antigenic tumors. To identify
      the molecular bases for such defective differentiation, we monitored gene
      expression in naive monoclonal CD8 T cells during responses to TCR ligands
      of different affinity. We further evaluated whether responses to weak Ags
      may be improved by addition of cytokines. Transient gene expression was
      observed for a cluster of genes in response to the weak TCR agonist.
      Strikingly, gene expression was stabilized by low dose IL-2. This
      IL-2-sustained gene cluster encoded notably transcripts for CD25,
      cytolytic effector molecules (granzyme B) and TNF-R family costimulatory
      molecules (glucocorticoid-induced TNF-R (GITR), OX40, and 4-1BB).
      IL-2-enhanced surface expression or function was also demonstrated in vivo
      for these genes. A constitutive active form of STAT5 mimicked the IL-2
      effect by sustaining transcripts for the same gene cluster. Consistent
      with this, under conditions of low avidity TCR engagement and IL-2
      treatment, endogenous STAT5 binding to 4-1BB and granzyme B promoters was
      demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. This study highlights those
      genes for which IL-2, via STAT5 activation, acts as a stabilizer of gene
      regulation initiated by TCR signals, contributing to the development of a
      complete CD8 T cell effector program.

TI  - [Activation of transcriptional factors stat5 and stat3 during human
      T-lymphocyte proliferation induced by different mitogenic stimuli]
PG  - 42-9
AB  - The activation of closely related transcription factors STAT5alpha and
      STAT5beta is one of the key signalling events during
      interleukin-2-dependent stage of T-lymphocyte proliferation. Here, we
      investigate the activation of STAT5 and STAT3 family proteins on different
      stages of T-cell proliferative response to various mitogenic stimuli. The
      activation of STAT proteins was estimated according to their tyrosine
      phosphorylation. Isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes were stimulated by
      phytogemagglutinin (PHA), or by phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) with
      calcium ionophore--ionomycin, or by exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2). After
      activation of T-cells by PHA as well as by PDBu with ionomycin we observed
      phosphorylation of STAT5 not earlier than in 5 h. The maximum
      phosphorylation (by 10 times and more, as compared to control resting
      lymphocytes) was detected following 24 h of mitogen stimulation. In the
      lymphocytes pretreated by PHA in submitogenic concentration, exogenous
      IL-2 induces a proliferative response. High phosphorylation level of STAT5
      was determined 10 min after addition of IL-2 and kept for the next 24 h.
      In contrast to STAT5, some basal phosphorylation of STAT3 was found in
      resting and PHA-pretreated T-cells. The profile of phosphorylation STAT3
      during mitogen-induced activation is more leveled. An immunosuppressant
      cyclosporine A taken at antiproliferative concentration decreased
      phosphorylation of both STAT5 and STAT3 by 1.5-2.0 times at early stages,
      as well as at late stages of activation. A correlation between alteration
      in tyrosine phosphorylation level of STAT5 and the expression of the high
      affinity IL-5 receptor was established. Taken together, we report that the
      increased STAT5 phosphorylation can serve as a marker of T-lymphocyte
      entrance into IL-2-dependent stage of proliferation after T-cell
      activation by different mitogens.

TI  - Phage phiC31 integrase-mediated genomic integration of the common cytokine
      receptor gamma chain in human T-cell lines.
PG  - 646-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1, X-SCID) is
      a life-threatening disease caused by a mutated common cytokine receptor
      gamma chain (gammac) gene. Although ex vivo gene therapy, i.e.,
      transduction of the gammac gene into autologous CD34(+) cells, has been
      successful for treating SCID-X1, the retrovirus vector-mediated transfer
      allowed dysregulated integration, causing leukemias. Here, to explore an
      alternative gene transfer methodology that may offer less risk of
      insertional mutagenesis, we employed the phiC31 integrase-based
      integration system using human T-cell lines, including the
      gammac-deficient ED40515(-). METHODS: A phiC31 integrase and a neo(r) gene
      expression plasmid containing the phiC31 attB sequence were co-delivered
      by electroporation into Jurkat cells. After G418 selection, integration
      site analyses were performed using linear amplification
      mediated-polymerase chain reaction (LAM-PCR). ED40515(-) cells were also
      transfected with a gammac expression plasmid containing attB, and the
      integration sites were determined. IL-2 stimulation was used to assess the
      functionality of the transduced gammac in an ED40515(-)-derived clone.
      RESULTS: Following co-introduction of the phiC31 integrase expression
      plasmid and the plasmid carrying attB, the efficiency of integration into
      the unmodified human genome was assessed. Several integration sites were
      characterized, including new integration sites in intergenic regions on
      chromosomes 13 and 18 that may be preferred in hematopoietic cells. An
      ED40515(-) line bearing the integrated gammac gene exhibited stable
      expression of the gammac protein, with normal IL-2 signaling, as assessed
      by STAT5 activation. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the possible future
      use of this phiC31 integrase-mediated genomic integration strategy as an
      alternative gene therapy approach for treating SCID-X1.

TI  - IL-27 suppresses CD28-mediated [correction of medicated] IL-2 production
      through suppressor of cytokine signaling 3.
PG  - 2773-80
AB  - IL-27 is a novel IL-6/IL-12 family cytokine that not only plays a role in
      the early regulation of Th1 differentiation, but also exerts an inhibitory
      effect on immune responses, including the suppression of proinflammatory
      cytokine production. However, the molecular mechanism by which IL-27
      exerts the inhibitory effect remains unclear. In this study we demonstrate
      that IL-27 inhibits CD28-mediated IL-2 production and that suppressor of
      cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) plays a critical role in the inhibitory
      effect. Although IL-27 enhanced IFN-gamma production from naive CD4+ T
      cells stimulated with plate-coated anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence
      of IL-12, IL-27 simultaneously inhibited CD28-mediated IL-2 production.
      Correlated with the inhibition, IL-27 was shown to augment SOCS3
      expression. Analyses using various mice lacking a signaling molecule
      revealed that the inhibition of IL-2 production was dependent on STAT1,
      but not on STAT3, STAT4, and T-bet, and was highly correlated with the
      induction of SOCS3 expression. Similar inhibition of CD28-mediated IL-2
      production and augmentation of SOCS3 expression by IL-27 were observed in
      a T cell hybridoma cell line, 2B4. Forced expression of antisense SOCS3 or
      dominant negative SOCS3 in the T cell line blocked the IL-27-inudced
      inhibition of CD28-mediated IL-2 production. Furthermore, pretreatment
      with IL-27 inhibited IL-2-mediated cell proliferation and STAT5
      activation, although IL-27 hardly affected the induction level of CD25
      expression. These results suggest that IL-27 inhibits CD28-mediated IL-2
      production and also IL-2 responses, and that SOCS3, whose expression is
      induced by IL-27, plays a critical role in the inhibitory effect in a
      negative feedback mechanism.

TI  - GATA-3 promotes Th2 responses through three different mechanisms:
      induction of Th2 cytokine production, selective growth of Th2 cells and
      inhibition of Th1 cell-specific factors.
PG  - 3-10
AB  - Naive CD4 T cells can differentiate into at least two different types of T
      helpers, Th1 and Th2 cells. Th2 cells, capable of producing IL-4, IL-5 and
      IL-13, are involved in humoral immunity against extracellular pathogens
      and in the induction of asthma and other allergic diseases. In this
      review, we summarize recent reports regarding the transcription factors
      involved in Th2 differentiation and cell expansion, including Stat5, Gfi-1
      and GATA-3. Stat5 activation is necessary and sufficient for IL-2-mediated
      function in Th2 differentiation. Enhanced Stat5 signaling induces Th2
      differentiation independent of IL-4 signaling; although it does not
      up-regulate GATA-3 expression, it does require the presence of GATA-3 for
      its action. Gfi-1, induced by IL-4, promotes the expansion of
      GATA-3-expressing cells. Analysis of conditional Gata3 knockout mice
      confirmed the critical role of GATA-3 in Th2 cell differentiation (both
      IL-4 dependent and IL-4 independent) and in Th2 cell proliferation and
      also showed the importance of basal GATA-3 expression in inhibiting Th1
      differentiation.

TI  - Interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) is up-regulated by CD40 triggering and
      mediates proapoptotic signals in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells.
PG  - 3708-15
AB  - Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a member of the IL-2 cytokine family, which
      mediates proliferation or growth arrest and apoptosis of normal B cells,
      depending on their activation state. Here we demonstrate that surface
      IL-21 receptor (R) is expressed at variable levels by chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) B cells freshly isolated from 33 different patients. IL-21R
      expression was up-regulated following cell stimulation via surface CD40.
      Therefore, IL-21 effects were more evident in CD40-activated CLL B cells.
      IL-21 induced an early signaling cascade in CLL B cells, which included
      JAK-1 and JAK-3 autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of
      STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5. IL-21 signaling failed to stimulate CLL B-cell
      proliferation, but induced their apoptosis. In addition, IL-21
      counteracted the proliferative and antiapoptotic signals delivered by
      IL-15 to CLL B cells. IL-21-mediated apoptosis involved activation of
      caspase-8 and caspase-3, cleavage of Bid to its active form t-Bid, and
      cleavage of PARP and of p27Kip-1. Recent data indicate that CLL B cells
      require interaction with the microenvironment for their survival and
      expansion. The present findings thus provide a set of new mechanisms
      involved in the balance between cell-survival and apoptotic signals in CLL
      B cells.

      factor absent in recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss (RPL).
PG  - 1872-80
AB  - Evidence suggests that maternal cell-mediated immunity is suppressed
      during pregnancy and that failure to suppress immune responses can result
      in partial or total rejection of the fetus. The molecular events
      associated with suppression of maternal T-cell activation mediated by
      circulating pregnancy-associated 14 kDa zeta inhibitor protein (ZIP) were
      defined in women with and without histories of recurrent pregnancy loss
      (RPL). Using cDNA microarray analysis, ZIP modulations of specific genes
      associated with T-cell activation signaling were defined. Alterations of
      defined components were confirmed at the protein level using
      chromatographically purified ZIP from normal pregnancies versus analogous
      material from women experiencing RPL. Based on microarray analyses, ZIP
      from normal pregnancies induced an increase (> or =2-fold) in the
      expression of 19 genes and a decrease (> or =2-fold) in 15 genes, when
      incubated with cultured T-cells. In contrast, when T-cells were incubated
      with analogous material from RPL or non-pregnant controls, no significant
      differences were observed in the expression of these genes. At the protein
      level, ZIP from normal pregnancies induced decreases in CD3-zeta
      (2.36-fold), JAK3 (2.41-fold), STAT5 (1.85-fold), and NF-kappaB
      (4.24-fold) and a 2.05-fold increase in SOCS2 (all at p<0.001 compared to
      RPL and non-pregnant controls). The suppressive effects of Zip can lead to
      the failure of T-cell production of Th1 cytokines, such as IL-2. The 14
      kDa circulating ZIP from normal pregnancies suppressed components within
      the JAK/STAT pathway and induced suppressors of cytokine stimulation,
      SOCS2.

TI  - A Stat5-overlapping site is critical for the IgJ enhancer activity in the
      plasma cells and bound by a ubiquitous protein.
PG  - 1897-905
AB  - Although the IgJ enhancer chromatin is induced open by an IL-2/Stat5
      signaling during terminal B cell differentiation, the opened chromatin of
      IgJ enhancer is then maintained in the absence of IL-2/Stat5 signaling.
      Nevertheless, the sequence overlapping the Stat5 site was shown still to
      be essential for the function of IgJ enhancer in the plasma cells. An in
      vivo footprint was identified over the Stat5-overlapping site, indicating
      that the site should be bound by a certain other protein than Stat5. In
      EMSA using the Stat5-overlapping sequence as a probe, its specific binding
      protein was identified. The specific binding protein corresponded neither
      to any of other Stat family proteins, nor to any of potential candidate
      proteins as tested in EMSA using their corresponding oligo DNA competitors
      and antibodies. Although its identity remains to be found by its
      purification, the protein binding specifically to the Stat5-overlapping
      site was shown to be expressed rather ubiquitously in B and non-B cells,
      and its molecular weight appeared to be below 52 kDa as determined in the
      UV-crosslinking-coupled SDS-PAGE.

TI  - Independent roles for IL-2 and GATA-3 in stimulating naive CD4+ T cells to
      generate a Th2-inducing cytokine environment.
PG  - 793-804
AB  - T cell receptor (TCR) signaling plays an important role in early
      interleukin (IL)-4 production by naive CD4+ T cells. This
      "antigen-stimulated" early IL-4 is sufficient for in vitro Th2
      differentiation. Here, we provide evidence that early IL-4 production by
      naive CD4+ T cells stimulated with cognate peptide requires TCR-induced
      early GATA-3 expression and IL-2 receptor signaling, both of which are
      controlled by the degree of activation of extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase (ERK). Stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells from TCR transgenic mice
      with low concentrations of peptide-induced IL-2-dependent STAT5
      phosphorylation, IL-4-independent early GATA-3 expression, and IL-4
      production. Neutralization of IL-2 abolished early IL-4 production without
      affecting early GATA-3 expression. In addition, naive CD4+ T cells from
      GATA-3 conditional KO mice failed to produce early IL-4 in response to
      TCR/CD28 stimulation. Stimulation with high concentrations of peptide
      abrogated early GATA-3 expression and IL-2-dependent STAT5
      phosphorylation, and resulted in the failure to produce early IL-4. This
      high concentration-mediated suppression of early IL-4 production was
      reversed by blockade of the ERK pathway. A MEK inhibition rescued early
      GATA-3 expression and responsiveness to IL-2; these cells were now capable
      of producing early IL-4 and undergoing subsequent Th2 differentiation.

TI  - CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells attenuate the phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase/Akt pathway in antigen-primed immature CD8+ CTLs during
      functional maturation.
PG  - 5959-67
AB  - This study was designed to determine the role of CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory
      T (Tr) cells in CTL maturation and effector functions using a murine CTL
      line and in vitro MLC. Tr cells inhibited CTL functional maturation, but
      had no effect on CTL effector functions. In CD4(+) responder T
      cell-depleted MLC supplemented with IL-2, Tr cells suppressed mature CTL
      generation only when added within the first 2 days of culture. Tr cells
      down-regulated levels of active Akt, but not STAT5 or ZAP70 in Ag-primed
      immature CTLs. Down-regulation of active Akt was accompanied by a
      reduction in CTL cell size and IL-2Ralpha expression. In Tr cell-depleted
      MLC, CTLs were generated that exhibited high levels of nonspecific
      cytotoxicity. Our in vitro findings suggest that Tr cells regulate
      functional CTL maturation to generate optimal Ag-specific immune responses
      through the control of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

TI  - A potential role for hydrocortisone in the positive regulation of
      IL-15-activated NK-cell proliferation and survival.
PG  - 158-66
AB  - Although glucocorticoids (GCs) have been described as acting mainly as
      anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, they may also positively
      influence the immune system. In the present study, we demonstrate for the
      first time that hydrocortisone (HC), in synergy with interleukin-15
      (IL-15), induces a dramatic increase in the expansion of peripheral
      blood-derived CD56+ cells, favoring the preferential outgrowth of
      classical natural killer (CD56+CD3- NK) over CD56+CD3+ natural killer T
      (NKT) cells. HC plus IL-15-driven CD56+ cells exhibited an increased
      potential for cytokine production with no impairment in their NK- and
      lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activities. Elevated levels of
      GC-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ) messenger RNA (mRNA) were
      detected in both NK and NKT cells cultured with HC and IL-15, in
      comparison to IL-15 alone. Phosphorylation status of signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was not affected by the presence of
      HC in either of the populations. On the contrary, HC differentially
      affected the IL-2/IL-15R beta- and gamma-chain surface expression and the
      phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2
      (ERK1/2) in IL-15-activated NK and NKT cells. Our data ascribe a novel
      role to GCs on mature NK-cell expansion and function and open new
      perspectives for their use in cellular adoptive cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - IL-2- and STAT5-regulated cytokine gene expression in cells expressing the
      Tax protein of HTLV-1.
PG  - 4624-33
AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) mediates cell cycle progression and antiapoptosis in
      human T cells via several signal transduction pathways. The Tax protein of
      the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) deregulates cell growth
      and alters the role of IL-2 in infected cells. However, Tax-immortalized
      cells stay dependent on IL-2, suggesting that events besides HTLV-1 gene
      expression are required for leukemia to develop. Here, IL-2-dependent and
      -independent events were analysed in a human T cell line immortalized by
      Tax. These studies show that, of the signaling pathways evaluated, only
      STAT5 remains dependent. Microarray analyses revealed several genes,
      including il-5, il-9 and il-13, are uniquely upregulated by IL-2 in the
      presence of Tax. Bioinformatics and supporting molecular biology show that
      some of these genes are STAT5 targets, explaining their IL-2 upregulation.
      These results suggest that IL-2 and viral proteins work together to induce
      gene expression, promoting the hypothesis that deregulation via the
      constitutive activation of STAT5 may lead to the IL-2-independent
      phenotype of HTLV-1-transformed cells.
