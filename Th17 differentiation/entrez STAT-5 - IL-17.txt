TI  - CD69 association with Jak3/Stat5 proteins regulates Th17 cell
      differentiation.
PG  - 4877-89
AB  - T-cell differentiation involves the early decision to commit to a
      particular pattern of response to an antigen. Here, we show that the
      leukocyte activation antigen CD69 limits differentiation into
      proinflammatory helper T cells (Th17 cells). Upon antigen stimulation in
      vitro, CD4(+) T cells from CD69-deficient mice generate an expansion of
      Th17 cells and the induction of greater mRNA expression of interleukin 17
      (IL-17), IL 23 receptor (IL-23R), and the nuclear receptor retinoic
      acid-related orphan receptor gammat (RORgammat). In vivo studies with
      CD69-deficient mice bearing OTII T-cell receptors (TCRs) specific for OVA
      peptide showed a high proportion of antigen-specific Th17 subpopulation in
      the draining lymph nodes, as well as in CD69-deficient mice immunized with
      type II collagen. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the CD69
      cytoplasmic tail associates with the Jak3/Stat5 signaling pathway, which
      regulates the transcription of RORgammat and, consequently,
      differentiation toward the Th17 lineage. Functional experiments in Th17
      cultures demonstrated that the selective inhibition of Jak3 activation
      enhanced the transcription of RORgammat. Moreover, the addition of
      exogenous IL-2 restored Stat5 phosphorylation and inhibited the enhanced
      Th17 differentiation in CD69-deficient cells. These results support the
      early activation receptor CD69 as an intrinsic modulator of the T-cell
      differentiation program that conditions immune inflammatory processes.

TI  - IL-23 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 134-45
AB  - Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a heterodimeric cytokine belonging to the
      IL-6/IL-12 family that plays a key role in several of autoimmune and
      inflammatory disorders. This family contains the 34 type I cytokine
      receptor chains and 27 ligands, which share structural and functional
      similarities, but on the other hand they display distinct roles in shaping
      Th cells responses. IL-12 family cytokines have not only proinflammatory
      effects but they also promote inflammatory responses. IL-23 is composed of
      the p40 subunit in common with IL-12, and with a unique p19 subunit. IL-23
      binding to an IL-23 receptor expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages and
      monocytes triggers the activation of Jak2 and Tyk2, which in turn
      phosphorylates STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 as well as induce formation
      of STAT3-STAT4 heterodimers. IL-23 is one of the essential factors
      required for the survival and/or expansion of Th17 cells, which produce
      IL-17, IL-17F, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Th17 cells stimulated by the IL-23
      promote osteoclastogenesis through production of IL-17, which induce
      receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand on mesenchymal cells. The
      IL-23-IL-17 axis includes Th17 cells and plays a key role in the
      development of autoimmune arthritis.

TI  - JAK3 inhibition significantly attenuates psoriasiform skin inflammation in
      CD18 mutant PL/J mice.
PG  - 2183-92
AB  - JAK3, a member of the Janus kinase family, is predominantly expressed in
      hemopoietic cells and binds specifically to the common gamma chain of a
      subfamily of cytokine receptors that includes IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9,
      IL-15, and IL-21. Previous studies suggest that this tyrosine kinase plays
      key roles in mediating T cell functions, and inhibition of JAK3 has been
      shown to prevent graft rejection and decrease the severity of arthritis in
      rodent models. However, the functions of JAK3 in the development of skin
      immune responses and diseases such as psoriasis have not been determined.
      CD18 mutant PL/J mice develop spontaneous T cell-dependent psoriasiform
      skin disease with several similarities to human psoriasis. In this study,
      we treated mice with established skin disease with R348, a small molecule
      inhibitor of JAK3, and observed a marked attenuation of skin lesions
      following 6 wk of treatment. Histological analyses revealed major
      reductions of both epidermal and dermal lesion severity scores in
      R348-treated CD18-deficient PL/J mice compared with vehicle controls,
      which was associated with decreased CD4(+) T cell infiltration. In
      addition, systemic levels of IL-17, IL-22, IL-23, and TNF-alpha were
      significantly lower in mice receiving the compound, and T cells isolated
      from R348-treated mice also showed reduced phosphorylation of Stat5 after
      stimulation with IL-2. These findings suggest that small-molecule
      inhibitors of JAK3 may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory skin
      diseases such as psoriasis and strongly implicate JAK signaling events as
      important in the pathogenesis of this disease.

TI  - Regulatory T cells and extracorporeal photochemotherapy: correlation with
      clinical response and decreased frequency of proinflammatory T cells.
PG  - 1422-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune mechanisms of extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) in
      refractory/resistant graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) are complex. We have
      previously analyzed the role of CD4CD25Foxp3 regulatory T cells (T-regs).
      METHODS: In the current study, we have enlarged the size of the population
      (n=27; chronic GvHD=18, acute GvHD=9) for a median follow-up of 24 months.
      T-regs were monitored for CD4, CD25, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis
      factor receptor (GITR), CD62L, CCR7, Foxp3, and STAT-5. Immune analysis by
      interleukin (IL)-17 Elispot was carried out on circulating T-helper CD4
      cells secreting IL-17, a subset of T cells considered relevant in the
      pathogenesis of GvHD. RESULTS: We confirm that ECP is accompanied by a
      significant increase of CD4CD25Foxp3GITRCD62LCCR7 T-regs. Sorted T-regs
      show augmented phosphorylation of STAT-5. Only ECP-responding patients
      demonstrate a raise of circulating T-regs, being mostly affected by
      chronic GvHD. Moreover, this phenomenon corresponds to a diminished
      secretion of IL-17. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our study shows that T-regs
      represent important immune mediators of the clinical benefits of ECP in
      patients affected by GvHD.

TI  - Signal transduction inhibition of APCs diminishes th17 and Th1 responses
      in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
PG  - 4192-9
AB  - IL-17- and IFN-gamma-secreting T cells play an important role in
      autoimmune responses in multiple sclerosis and the model system
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Dendritic cells (DCs) in
      the periphery and microglia in the CNS are responsible for cytokine
      polarization and expansion of this T cell subset. Our results indicate
      that in vivo administration of a signal transduction inhibitor that
      targets DCs to mice with EAE led to a decrease in CNS infiltration of
      pathogenic Ag-specific T cells. Since this approach does not target T
      cells directly, we assessed the effects on the APCs that are involved in
      generating the T cell responses. Since in EAE and multiple sclerosis, both
      microglia and peripheral DCs are likely to contribute to disease, we
      utilized a bone marrow chimera system to distinguish between these two
      populations. These studies show that peripheral DCs are the primary target
      but that microglia are also modestly affected by CEP-701, as numbers and
      activation states of the cells in the CNS are decreased after therapy. Our
      results also showed a decrease in secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-23
      by DCs as well as a decrease in expression of costimulatory molecules. We
      further determined that levels of phospho-Stat1, Stat3, Stat5, and
      NF-kappaB, which are signaling molecules that have been implicated in
      these pathways, were decreased. Thus, use of this class of signal
      transduction inhibitors may represent a novel method to treat autoimmunity
      by dampening the autoreactive polarizing condition driven by DCs.

TI  - Natural agonists for aryl hydrocarbon receptor in culture medium are
      essential for optimal differentiation of Th17 T cells.
PG  - 43-9
AB  - Th17 cell differentiation is dependent on interleukin (IL)-6 and
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and it is modulated by activation
      of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In this study, we show that
      differentiation of Th17 cells, but not Th1 or induced regulatory T (iT
      reg) cells, is increased by endogenous AhR agonists present in culture
      medium. Th17 development from wild-type mice is suboptimal in the presence
      of the AhR antagonist CH-223191, similar to the situation in AhR-deficient
      mice, which show attenuated IL-17 production and no IL-22 production. The
      presence of natural AhR agonists in culture medium is also revealed by the
      induction of CYP1A1, a downstream target of AhR activation. However, the
      most commonly used medium, RPMI, supports very low levels of Th17
      polarization, whereas Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, a medium richer
      in aromatic amino acids, which give rise to AhR agonists, consistently
      results in higher Th17 expansion in both mouse and human cells. The
      relative paucity of AhR agonists in RPMI medium, coupled with the presence
      of factors conducive to IL-2 activation and enhanced Stat5
      phosphorylation, conspire against optimal Th17 differentiation. Our data
      emphasize that AhR activation plays an essential part in the development
      of Th17 cells and provide a rational explanation for the poor in vitro
      polarization of Th17 cells that is reported in the majority of
      publications for both mouse and human cells.

TI  - Effects of high-dose IFNalpha2b on regional lymph node metastases of human
      melanoma: modulation of STAT5, FOXP3, and IL-17.
PG  - 8314-20
AB  - PURPOSE: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and
      STAT3 oppose one another in regulation of the reciprocal development of
      CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17). A
      reduction in STAT3 is associated with up-regulation of Treg, and STAT5
      activation promotes Treg differentiation or function while constraining
      Th17 generation. The effects of IFNalpha on STAT signaling in relation to
      tumor tissue Treg and Th17 have not been documented in humans beyond the
      observations that IFNalpha2b down-regulates STAT3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
      Following diagnostic biopsy and before definitive surgery, 20 doses of
      high-dose IFNalpha2b (HDI) were administered to patients with stage IIIB
      melanoma who gave written informed consent. Lymph node biopsies, in which
      both total STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 were down-regulated by HDI, were
      probed with STAT5, FOXP3, CD4, and interleukin 17 (IL-17) with
      immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence techniques. RESULTS: The
      percentage of FOXP3+ lymphocytes determined by immunohistochemistry was
      up-regulated from 3.06 +/- 0.65% to 9.86 +/- 1.27% (n = 13, P = 0.0002),
      and this observation was confirmed by immunofluorescence evaluation of
      CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs. HDI induced STAT5 up-regulation (five cases observed) in
      melanoma cells and lymphocytes but did not induce the generation of
      IL-17-expressing lymphocytes. Increased STAT5 expression was associated
      with increased FOXP3 expression among lymphocytes, and STAT5 was
      constitutively activated among both melanoma cells and lymphocytes.
      CONCLUSION: IFNalpha2b up-regulates STAT5 and down-regulates STAT3, in
      conjunction with up-regulation of Treg and inhibition of IL-17-expressing
      lymphocytes in melanoma tissues. These findings suggest that the effects
      of IFNalpha may be potentiated through interference with the response of
      Tregs and/or STAT5.

TI  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates Stat1 activation and participates in
      the development of Th17 cells.
PG  - 9721-6
AB  - IL-17-producing T helper cells (Th17) have been recently identified as a
      previously undescribed subset of helper T cells. Here, we demonstrate that
      aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) has an important regulatory function in
      the commitment of Th17 cells. Ahr was robustly induced under
      Th17-polarizing conditions. Ahr-deficient naive T cells showed a
      considerable loss in the ability to differentiate into Th17 cells when
      induced by TGF-beta plus IL-6. We were able to demonstrate that Ahr
      interacts with Stat1 and Stat5, which negatively regulate Th17
      development. Whereas Stat1 activation returned to its basal level in Ahr
      wild type naive T cells 24 h after stimulation with TGF-beta plus IL-6,
      Stat1 remained activated in Ahr-deficient naive T cells after stimulation.
      These results indicate that Ahr participates in Th17 cell differentiation
      through regulating Stat1 activation, a finding that constitutes additional
      mechanisms in the modulation of Th17 cell development.

TI  - Differential regulation of the IL-17 receptor by gammac cytokines:
      inhibitory signaling by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.
PG  - 14100-8
AB  - The gammac-family cytokine IL-2 activates signaling events that contribute
      to cell survival and proliferation, the best-studied of which are the
      STAT-5 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. The starting
      point of this study was to define genes regulated by the IL-2R-mediated
      PI3K pathway in T cells. Accordingly, we used an erythropoietin (EPO)
      receptor chimeric receptor system in which IL-2-dependent HT-2 T cells
      expressed a mutant EPO-IL-2Rbeta construct where Tyr-338 is mutated to
      Phe. Cells expressing this mutant IL-2Rbeta chain fail to induce
      phosphorylation of PI3K-p85alpha/beta or activate Akt, but mediate normal
      IL-2-dependent proliferation and activation of JAK1 and STAT-5A/B.
      Microarray analyses revealed differential regulation of numerous genes
      compared with cells expressing a wild-type IL-2Rbeta, including
      up-regulation of the IL-17 receptor subunit IL-17RA. Blockade of the PI3K
      pathway but not p70S6K led to up-regulation of IL-17RA, and constitutive
      Akt activation was associated with suppressed IL-17RA expression.
      Moreover, similar to the mutant EPO-IL-2Rbeta chimera, IL-15 and IL-21
      induced IL-17RA preferentially compared with IL-2, and IL-2 but not IL-15
      or IL-21 mediated prolonged activation of the PI3K p85 regulatory subunit.
      Thus, there are intrinsic signaling differences between IL-2 and IL-15
      that can be attributed to differences in activation of the PI3K pathway.

TI  - Ets-1 is a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation.
PG  - 2825-35
AB  - IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a role in the clearance of
      extracellular bacteria and contributes to the pathology of many autoimmune
      and allergic conditions. IL-17 is produced mainly by a newly characterized
      subset of T helper (Th) cells termed Th17. Although the role of Th17 cells
      in the pathology of autoimmune diseases is well established, the
      transcription factors regulating the differentiation of Th17 cells remain
      poorly characterized. We report that Ets-1-deficient Th cells
      differentiated more efficiently to Th17 cells than wild-type cells. This
      was attributed to both low IL-2 production and increased resistance to the
      inhibitory effect of IL-2 on Th17 differentiation. The resistance to IL-2
      suppression was caused by a defect downstream of STAT5 phosphorylation,
      but was not caused by a difference in the level of RORgamma t.
      Furthermore, Ets-1-deficient mice contained an abnormally high level of
      IL-17 transcripts in their lungs and exhibited increased mucus production
      by airway epithelial cells in an IL-17-dependent manner. Based on these
      observations, we report that Ets-1 is a negative regulator of Th17
      differentiation.

TI  - Retinoic acid inhibits Th17 polarization and enhances FoxP3 expression
      through a Stat-3/Stat-5 independent signaling pathway.
PG  - 1013-20
AB  - CD4(+) helper T (Th) cells play a crucial role in the delicate balance
      between host defense and autoimmune disease. Two important populations of
      helper T cells are the proinflammatory, interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing
      (Th17) cells and the anti-inflammatory forkhead box P3-positive (FoxP3(+))
      T regulatory (Treg) cells. Here we show that all-trans retinoic acid
      (ATRA) and other agonists of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha)
      inhibit the formation of Th17 cells and promote FoxP3 expression.
      Conversely, inhibition of retinoic acid signaling constrains transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) induction of FoxP3. The effect of ATRA is
      mediated independently of IL-2, signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 5 (Stat5) and Stat3, representing a novel mechanism for the
      induction of FoxP3 in CD4 T cells. As previous studies have shown that
      vitamin A derivatives are protective in animal models of autoimmune
      disease, the current data suggest a previously unrecognized role for
      RARalpha in the regulation of CD4(+) T-cell differentiation and provide a
      mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of retinoic acid.

TI  - Interleukin-2 signaling via STAT5 constrains T helper 17 cell generation.
PG  - 371-81
AB  - Recent work has identified a new subset of effector T cells that produces
      interleukin (IL)-17 known as T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which is involved
      in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and is thought to be
      developmentally related to regulatory T (Treg) cells. Because of its
      importance for Treg cells, we examined the role of IL-2 in Th17 generation
      and demonstrate that a previously unrecognized aspect of IL-2 function is
      to constrain IL-17 production. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of
      IL-2 promoted differentiation of the Th17 cell subset. Whereas STAT3
      appeared to be a key positive regulator of RORgammat and IL-17 expression,
      absence of IL-2 or disruption of its signaling by deletion of the
      transcription factor STAT5 resulted in enhanced Th17 cell development. We
      conclude that in addition to the promotion of activation-induced cell
      death of lymphocytes and the generation of Treg cells, inhibition of Th17
      polarization appears to be an important function of IL-2.
