Summary
Recent work has identified a new subset of effector T cells that produces interleukin (IL)-17 known as T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which is involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and is thought to be developmentally related to regulatory T (Treg) cells. Because of its importance for Treg cells, we examined the role of IL-2 in Th17 generation and demonstrate that a previously unrecognized aspect of IL-2 function is to constrain IL-17 production. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of IL-2 promoted differentiation of the Th17 cell subset. Whereas STAT3 appeared to be a key positive regulator of RORγt and IL-17 expression, absence of IL-2 or disruption of its signaling by deletion of the transcription factor STAT5 resulted in enhanced Th17 cell development. We conclude that in addition to the promotion of activation-induced cell death of lymphocytes and the generation of Treg cells, inhibition of Th17 polarization appears to be an important function of IL-2.

Introduction
In response to various infectious organisms, the adaptive immune system generates distinct responses, which in part are governed by the pattern of cytokines secreted by effector T cells. Although T helper (Th) cells secrete an array of cytokines, until recently, these cells were divided into two groups on the basis of their cytokine profiles: Th1 cells that secrete IFN-γ and Th2 cells that secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 ([Abbas et al., 1996], [Flavell, 1999], [Glimcher, 2001], [Mosmann and Coffman, 1989] and [Murphy and Reiner, 2002]). Th1 cells are essential for controlling intracellular infectious organisms whereas Th2 cells are important for host defense against helminth infections. These Th cell lineages have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disease. For instance, Th1 cells have been thought to contribute to pathology in Crohn's disease (Strober et al., 1998), whereas Th2 cells have been implicated in asthma (Umetsu et al., 2002). In general, though, autoimmune diseases are not easily explained by a dichotomous view of helper T cell differentiation.
The interleukin (IL)-17 family members 17A and 17F have been implicated in host defense against extracellular bacteria; IL-17 receptor-deficient mice are susceptible to bacterial pneumonias and are unable to form abdominal abscesses (Ye et al., 2001). Importantly though, IL-17 has also been found to be overexpressed in a variety of autoimmune and autoinflammatory syndromes, both in mice and in humans (McKenzie et al., 2006). The identification of a helper T cell lineage that selectively produced IL-17 was therefore of considerable interest ([Aggarwal et al., 2003], [Bettelli et al., 2006], [Cua et al., 2003], [Harrington et al., 2005], [Langrish et al., 2005], [Mangan et al., 2006], [Murphy et al., 2003] and [Veldhoen et al., 2006a]). Initially, it was thought that IL-23 induced the formation of Th17 effector cells; however, it is now thought that IL-23 maintains and expands this population of cells. The cytokines now thought to be critical for promoting Th17 differentiation are transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and IL-6 ([Bettelli et al., 2006], [Mangan et al., 2006] and [Veldhoen et al., 2006a]). In conjunction with T cell receptor stimulation, these cytokines induce the expression of the orphan nuclear receptor RORγt, which is critical for Th17 differentiation (Ivanov et al., 2006). These findings are also of interest in that TGF-β1 is important for maintenance peripheral regulatory T (Treg) cells ([Li et al., 2006] and [Marie et al., 2006]). That is, TGF-β1 alone promotes expression of the transcription factor FoxP3, whereas the combination of IL-6, TGF-β1 suppresses FoxP3 expression and enhances IL-17 production. Thus, the differentiation of Treg and Th17 cells by TGF-β1 appears to be reciprocally related, through the action of IL-6 ([Bettelli et al., 2006], [Veldhoen et al., 2006a] and [Veldhoen et al., 2006b]).
The development of Treg cells is regulated by IL-2 and IL-2Rα chain (Shevach et al., 2006). Accordingly, Il2−/− and IL2ra−/− mice develop systemic autoimmune disease characteristic of reduced Treg cell numbers ([Suzuki et al., 1995], [Abbas, 2003], [Malek, 2003], [Refaeli and Abbas, 1998] and [Refaeli et al., 1999]). In view of the apparent connection between Treg and Th17 cells (Bettelli et al., 2006), we were interested in exploring whether IL-2 had a role in Th17 differentiation. In the present study, we report that IL-2 negatively regulates Th17 differentiation and appears to be a mechanism for regulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells.
Results
IL-2 Inhibits In Vitro Differentiation of Th17 Cells
We first examined the potential role of IL-2 in Th17 generation by using several complementary approaches. As previously reported, in vitro culture of naive CD4+ T cells with IL-6 and TGF-β1 along with blocking antibodies against IL-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ (denoted henceforth as optimal Th17 conditions) resulted in an increased proportion of cells that selectively produce IL-17 and not IFN-γ compared to cells cultured in medium alone (Figure 1A). We first assessed a role for IL-2 by adding excess exogenous IL-2 to these cultures. This resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the proportion of IL-17-producing cells with no change in the proportion of IFN-γ-producing cells (Figure 1A). Activated T cells produce endogenous IL-2, so we next investigated the contribution of this cytokine by adding IL-2 antibodies. Blockade of IL-2 in these cultures increased the proportion of IL-17-producing cells, as determined by intracellular cytokine staining (Figures 1B–1D) and ELISA (data not shown); conversely, addition of exogenous human IL-2 reversed this effect. After 3 days of culture, the addition of human IL-2 to the sample receiving anti-mouse IL-2 resulted in a small increase in cell number that was not statistically significant (0.7 × 106 cells/ml ± 0.22 versus 1.01 × 106 cells/ml ± 0.25, p = 0.11). Additionally, we observed a decrease in the percentage of FoxP3-positive cells that was inversely proportional to the increased percentage of IL-17-producing cells when IL-2 was blocked (Figure 1D). Thus, these data illustrate the ability of IL-2 to expand Treg cells and simultaneously restrict Th17 development. This is consistent with the idea that Treg and Th17 cells may be reciprocally regulated (Bettelli et al., 2006); in this case, IL-2 is an important factor in fate determination of both lineages. It is notable that TGF-β1, an important factor for Th17 polarization, is an inhibitor of IL-2 production; this could be one means by which this cytokine promotes differentiation of this lineage (McKarns et al., 2004).

Figure 1. IL-2 Restricts In Vitro Generation of IL-17-Secreting CD4+ T Cells

(A and B) Sorted naive (CD62L+ CD44− CD25−) CD4+ T cells from wild-type C57Bl6 mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in media alone or under optimal Th17-polarizing conditions for 3 days and analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of intracellular cytokines. Percentages of CD4+ T cells positive for intracellular IFN-γ or IL-17 are shown after culture in the presence of 0, 10, 50, or 100 iu/ml of exogenous rhIL-2. Shown in (B) are three experiments analyzing both the effect of increasing doses of rhIL-2 as described above and the addition of anti-mouse IL-2 and its rescue with the addition of rhIL-2 at 100 iu/mL. Significant differences were determined by Student's t test and are denoted by a double asterisk (p < 0.01) or by a triple asterisk (p < 0.001).

(C and D) CD4+ T cells were cultured as in (A), but in the absence (top rows) or presence (bottom rows) of a blocking antibody for murine IL-2, without (middle columns) or with (right columns) exogenous rhIL-2. Intracellular staining for IFN-γ versus IL-17 (C) or FoxP3 versus IL-17 (D) is shown.


IL-2 Deficiency Is Associated with Enhanced IL-17 Production
To more clearly define a role of IL-2 in Th17 polarization, we took a third approach of culturing Il2−/− CD4+ T cells in vitro under Th17-polarizing conditions in the presence or absence of exogenous IL-2. As shown in Figure 2A, T cells from Il2−/− mice had a marked increase in the percentage of IL-17-producing cells compared to wild-type cells. Addition of IL-2 into polarizing cultures reduced the percentage of IL-17-producing cells in wild-type cells and normalized IL-17 production by Il2−/− cells. These data substantiate the contention that IL-2 limits IL-17 production. The addition of IL-2 to Il2−/− T cells had no significant increase in cell number after 3 days of T cell receptor stimulation (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online) irrespective of culture condition.

Figure 2. IL-2 Inhibits IL-17 Production Both In Vitro and In Vivo

(A) CD4+ T cells from wild-type or Il2−/− C57Bl6 mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 under Th17 conditions for 3 days in the presence or absence of IL-2, followed by intracellular staining for IFN-γ versus IL-17. The numbers indicate the percentage of CD4+ T cells that express IL-17 and are representative of data from two independent experiments.

(B) Serum concentrations of IL-17 were analyzed in Il2−/− (n = 5) and wild-type (n = 5) mice by ELISA. The amounts were significantly different (p = 0.02) as assessed by an unpaired (unequal variance) test and are denoted by a single asterisk (p < 0.05).

(C) Mesenteric lymph node cells from wild-type and Il2−/− mice were harvested, stimulated for 4 hr with PMA and ionomycin, fixed, and stained for the presence of IL-17 and the expression of CD4 by flow cytometry. The numbers shown indicate the percentage of total cells and are representative of data from two independent experiments.


To determine whether IL-2 was an important in vivo regulator of IL-17 homeostasis, we next measured serum concentration of IL-17 in 3-month-old wild-type versus Il2−/− mice. Whereas IL-17 was undetectable in normal mice, Il2−/− mice had significantly elevated concentration of this cytokine in serum (Figure 2B, p = 0.02). The mesenteric lymph nodes from Il2−/− and wild-type mice were analyzed for the presence of IL-17-expressing cells: consistent with the elevated concentration of IL-17 in serum, peripheral lymph nodes from Il2−/− lymph node cells had a greater proportion of IL-17-positive cells, most of which were CD4 positive (Figure 2C). Taking into account the peripheral lymphadenopathy associated with Il2−/− mice, there was a 30-fold difference in absolute numbers of mesenteric Th17 cells compared with wild-type mice (data not shown).
IL-2 Deficiency Is Associated with Enhanced Th17 Cell Generation In Vivo
Because of the widespread autoimmune disease in Il2−/− mice and the activated phenotype of CD4+ T cells from these animals, we thought it important to confirm the requirement of IL-2 for suppression of Th17 cells by using a different system. To eliminate the potentially confounding aspect of autoimmune disease, we used mice deficient in IL-2 that express a restricted T cell receptor repertoire. Thus, B10.A Il2−/− Rag2−/− 5C.C7 mice, which express a transgenic T cell receptor (5C.C7) specific to the nonendogenous antigen pigeon cytochrome c (PCC), were used as a source of naive CD4+ T cells. Culture of the Il2−/− Rag2−/− 5C.C7 T cells under optimal Th17 conditions also resulted in a large proportion of IL-17-producing cells (Figure 3A, top). Again, the addition of exogenous IL-2 to the cultures substantially reduced Th17 polarization. In contrast, IL-23, anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-4 had no effect on polarization irrespective of IL-2, indicative of the fact that this population did not include significant number of memory CD4+ T cells (Veldhoen et al., 2006a). Finally, the addition of IL-2 to Il2−/−Rag2−/− CD4+ T cells stimulated under Th1-polarizing conditions (IL-12 and anti-IL-4) increased the proportion of cells expressing IFN-γ.

Figure 3. IL-2 Inhibits IL-17 Production in the Absence of Autoimmune Disease

(A) CD4+ T cells from Bl10 Rag2−/− TCR transgenic specific for pigeon cytochrome c with or without deletion of the Il2 gene were polyclonally stimulated for 3 days either in media alone (Th0); in the presence of IL-12 and anti IL-4 (Th1 conditions); in the presence of IL-23, anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-4; or in the presence of optimal Th17 differentiating conditions. The stimulations were performed in the presence or absence of IL-2 and subsequently stained for IFN-γ and IL-17. The numbers indicate the percentage of CD4+ T cells that express either IL-17 (top left quadrants) or IFN-γ (bottom right quadrants) and are representative of data from two independent experiments.

(B) CD4+ T cells from B10.A Rag2−/− 5C.C7 TCR transgenic mice with (top) or without (bottom) deletion of the Il2 gene were injected i.v. into congenic (CD45.1) B10.A mice. The next day mice received s.c. injections of PCC peptide together with CFA. The draining lymph nodes were harvested after 7 days. Cells were stimulated for 4 hr with PMA and ionomycin, fixed and stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD44, IL-17, and IFN-γ expression is shown for the gated CD45.2+ cell population. Representative data from four independent experiments are shown.


To further explore whether IL-2 has the capacity to regulate Th17 generation during a normal in vivo immune response, in the presence of normal numbers of Treg cells, no autoimmunity, and without the use of exogenous cytokines, we used an adoptive transfer approach. Naive B10.A Rag2−/− 5C.C7 or B10.A Il2−/− Rag2−/− 5C.C7 T cells (both CD45.2+) were injected intravenously into B10.A congenic (CD45.1+) recipient mice and immunized with cognate peptide. 7 days later, draining lymph nodes were analyzed for T cell cytokine production. In this experiment, 3.27% of B10.A Rag2−/− 5C.C7 T cells became IL-17 producers, consistent with recent reports (Murphy et al., 2003). In contrast, more than twice as many Th17 cells were generated from B10.A Il2−/−Rag2−/− 5C.C7 T cells, whereas the numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells were reduced. The data shown in Figure 3B are representative of four experiments, which consistently showed a doubling of IL-17 producers. Although the proportions of IL-17 producers is small, it must be borne in mind that this experiment represents in vivo Th17 differentiation in response to vaccination, without addition of exogenous cytokines or blocking antibodies. In contrast with the donor cells, polyclonal nontransgenic host T cells were not activated in this setting. CD44 expression was used to monitor both the lack of responsiveness of the host cells (data not shown) and the activation of the adoptively transferred TCR transgenic T cells (Figure 3B, right). In both settings, the recipient mice were not deficient in IL-2 and it is possible that this diminished the proportion of Th17 cells present in the transgenic T cells. Nonetheless, in vivo, without addition of exogenous cytokines, the presence of IL-2 clearly inhibited the proportion of IL-17-producing T cells. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-2 regulates IL-17 production in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the overproduction of IL-17 associated with IL-2 deficiency appears not to be secondary to the autoimmune disease but is a primary defect.
Opposing Roles of STAT3 and STAT5 in Th17 Differentiation
STAT3 is activated by IL-6 and IL-23, two cytokines that promote IL-17 production by T cells ([Harrington et al., 2005] and [Veldhoen et al., 2006a]). We therefore next analyzed the importance of this transcription factor in IL-17 regulation. In comparison to wild-type CD4+ T cells, T cells in which STAT3 amounts were reduced through a conditional Cre-lox targeted deletion revealed marked reduction in the proportion of IL-17-producing cells, indicating a key role in IL-17 regulation (Figure 4A). Conversely, the proportion of FoxP3-expressing T cells was increased when STAT3 was absent, indicative of its role in mediating IL-6 signaling to repress FoxP3 (Yao et al., 2007). The reduction in STAT3 was documented by immunoblotting (Figure 4B). The nuclear orphan receptor RORγt has recently been identified as a critical transcription factor in the expression of IL-17A by CD4+ T cells (Ivanov et al., 2006). We therefore compared RORγt mRNA expression in Stat3-deleted CD4+ T cells compared with littermate controls. In keeping with previous reports (Ivanov et al., 2006), the expression of RORγt was elevated under Th17 conditions in littermate controls but not in STAT3-deleted cells (Figure 4C). Moreover, the addition of human IL-2 resulted in a marked reduction in the expression of RORγt, suggesting one mechanism of action by which IL-2 might inhibit Th17 differentiation (Figure 4D).

Figure 4. Critical Role of STAT3 in the Regulation of IL-17 and RORγt

(A) CD4+ T cells from Stat3fl/fl; MMTV-Cre mice or littermate control mice were polyclonally stimulated for 3 days in media alone or under optimal Th17 conditions. The cells were subsequently analyzed for intracellular levels of FoxP3 and IL-17 by flow cytometry. The percentages indicated are representative of data from three independent experiments.

(B) CD4+ T cells from Stat3fl/fl and Stat3fl/fl; MMTV-Cre mice polyclonally stimulated and expanded in IL-2-containing media were rested in media without cytokine for 6 hr followed by a 5 min stimulation with IL-6 at 10 ng/mL. Cells were subsequently lysed and immunoblotted for the expression of phospho-tyrosine STAT3, pan STAT3, and actin.

(C) CD4+ T cells from Stat3fl/fl mice (white bars) or Stat3fl/fl; MMTV-Cre mice (black bars) were polyclonally stimulated for 3 days in media alone (Th0); in the presence of IL-12 and anti IL-4 (Th1 conditions); in the presence of TGF-β1; or in the presence of optimal Th17 differentiating conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed for the presence of RORγt mRNA by quantitative PCR, and values are normalized to the expression level in wild-type T cells polarized under Th0 conditions. Histograms represent mean values and error bars represent SD values. The data shown are duplicates and are representative of two independent experiments.

(D) CD4+ T cells from C57Bl6 mice were polyclonally stimulated for 3 days in media alone (Th0); in the presence of IL-12 and anti IL-4 (Th1 conditions); in the presence of TGF-β1; or in the presence of optimal Th17 differentiating conditions all in the presence of anti-mouse IL-2 with (white bars) or without (black bars) the addition of 100 iu/mL rhIL-2. Cell lysates were analyzed for the presence of RORγt mRNA by quantitative PCR, and values are normalized to the expression level in wild-type T cells polarized under Th0 conditions. Histograms represent mean values and error bars represent SD values. The data shown are duplicates and are representative of two independent experiments.


IL-2-Mediated Activation of STAT5 Opposes Th17 Cell Differentiation
IL-2 and other common γ chain (γc)-cytokines are potent activators of STAT5a and STAT5b, transcription factors that have critical in vivo functions in lymphoid development ([Beadling et al., 1994], [Johnston et al., 1995] and [Yao et al., 2006]). Deletion of STAT5a and STAT5b via a transgenic expression of CD4-Cre (Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre) with resultant expression in DP thymocytes results in loss of CD8+ T cells in the periphery. The CD4+ T cells that are present overwhelmingly exhibit a memory cell phenotype (Yao et al., 2006). We therefore in vitro polarized Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre and wild-type littermate splenic CD4+ T cells as before in the presence of exogenous IL-2 (Figure 5A). Wild-type T cells expressed similar numbers of Th17 cells as documented in previous experiments, whereas, even when STAT5-deficient CD4+ T cells were cultured under conditions that did not normally favor IL-17 production (Th0), a large proportion of T cells selectively produced IL-17 (Figure 5A, bottom left), suggesting that these cells were prepolarized in vivo. In normal naive CD4+ T cells, IL-23 does not induce differentiation into IL-17 producers, but rather acts on memory T cells to expand this population ([Mangan et al., 2006] and [Veldhoen et al., 2006a]). Accordingly, IL-23 exposure had minimal effects on IL-17 production in wild-type T cells. However, IL-23 increased IL-17 production in Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre CD4+ T cells (Figure 5A, bottom middle), again consistent with the existence of a prepolarized or memory population of Th17 cells in Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice.

Figure 5. STAT5 Negatively Regulates Th17 Differentiation In Vitro and In Vivo

(A) CD4+ T cells from Stat5a/bfl/fl or Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 3 days in IL-2 alone or IL-2 together with either IL-23, anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-4; or under optimal Th17 conditions, and cells were subsequently stained for IFN-γ and IL-17. Representative data from two independent experiments are shown.

(B) CD4+ T cells from Stat5a/bfl/fl mice (white bars) or Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice (black bars) were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, prior to measuring levels of IL-17 protein in culture supernatants by ELISA at 24, 48, and 72 hr. Histograms represent mean values and error bars represent SD values. The three asterisks denote a significant difference (p < 0.001) as determined by an unpaired t test. The values shown were measured in triplicate and are representative of two independent experiments.

(C) Serum levels of IL-17 detected in wild-type (n = 5) and Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre (n = 5) mice. The asterisk denotes a significant difference (p = 0.013) as determined by an unpaired t test.


To further explore the idea that Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice contain a pre-existing population of peripheral lymphocytes that can readily produce IL-17, we activated Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and analyzed their competency to produce IL-17 by ELISA compared to littermate controls. We observed dramatically increased amounts of IL-17 protein in the Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre cultures over those produced by cultures of littermate controls at multiple time points (Figure 5B). As further evidence of the tendency of STAT5-deficient T cells to produce IL-17, significantly elevated levels of this protein were detectable in the serum of Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice, compared to wild-type littermates (p = 0.013) (Figure 5C). In interpreting this experiment, it should be kept in mind that Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice are modestly lymphopenic compared to wild-type and Il2−/− mice; however, it is clear that absence of STAT5 is associated with overproduction of IL-17 in vivo.
To circumvent the apparent prepolarization of peripheral STAT5-deficient T cells, we next used CD4+ single-positive (SP) thymocytes from Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice and littermate controls. In contrast to peripheral CD4+ lymphocytes from Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice, these cells expressed naive cell markers (data not shown). CD4+ SP thymocytes were stimulated as before under Th0 conditions or in the presence of neutralizing antibodies together with IL-23, TGF-β1, and IL-6 or TGF-β1 and IL-6 and IL-2 (Figure 6A). Few wild-type or Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre CD4+ SP thymocytes produced IL-17 in response to IL-23, indicative of the absence of memory T cells. Both cell populations produced IL-17 in response to TGF-β1 and IL-6; however, enhanced Th17 differentiation was seen in Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre CD4+ SP thymocytes. Furthermore, the proportion of IL-17 producers was significantly reduced by the addition of IL-2 (p = 0.012) in wild-type cells, whereas this response was blocked in Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre CD4+ SP thymocytes (Figure 6B). Thus, STAT5a and STAT5b appear to be important in limiting Th17 differentiation.

Figure 6. Inhibition of Th17 Differentiation by IL-2 Requires STAT5

(A) CD4+ SP thymocytes from Stat5a/bfl/fl or Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 3 days in media alone (Th0 conditions); together with IL-23, anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-4; or under optimal Th17 conditions with and without the addition of 100 iu/ml IL-2. Cells were fixed and stained for IL-17 and IFN-γ expression. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.

(B) Percentage of CD4+ T cells that expressed IL-17 was assessed by Student's t test from three independent experiments with in vitro culture conditions as described in (A). Histograms represent mean values from Stat5a/bfl/fl (white bars) or Stat5a/bfl/fl; CD4-Cre (black bars) CD4+ SP thymocytes, and error bars represent SD values. Significantly different levels p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 are denoted with a single or double asterisk, respectively.

(C) CD4+ T cells from C57Bl6 mice were polyclonally stimulated under neutral conditions for 3 days, rested in cytokine-free media (black bars), or stimulated with IL-2 (white bars). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated either with anti-STAT 5 or normal rabbit serum (NRS). Bound DNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR with Il17a promoter site-specific primers to region D. Histograms represent mean values and error bars represent SD values. The double asterisk denotes significant difference (p < 0.01) as determined by an unpaired t test. The values were measured in triplicate and are representative of three independent experiments.


As indicated above, by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we have previously shown that STAT3 directly binds to the Il17a promoter and that STAT5 directly binds the Foxp3 promoter ([Chen et al., 2006] and [Yao et al., 2007]). We therefore considered the possibility that another mechanism by which STAT5 might attenuate IL-17 production was by direct binding to the Il17a promoter. Initial investigation of the Il17a promoter sequences highlighted several potential STAT binding sites within −2K bp of the Il17a promoter. These sites were found within regions denoted A–D indicated in Figure S2. The binding of STAT5 to these regions was first assessed under conditions that would be expected to maximize its binding ([Bettelli et al., 2006] and [Yao et al., 2007]). Specific STAT5 binding was detected in all regions, although the region denoted D had the most consistent IL-2-inducible binding (Figure S2). Binding of STAT5 to the Foxp3 promoters was used as a control (data not shown; Yao et al., 2007). We next used quantitative PCR to more carefully measure the induction of STAT5 binding. Isolated CD4+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, washed to remove endogenously produced cytokines, and restimulated with IL-2. In this setting, STAT5 specifically bound to the Il17a gene (Figure 6C). Not surprisingly though, CD4+ T cells activated with CD3 and CD28 alone (which induces endogenous IL-2 production) also had very appreciable amounts of binding of STAT5 to the Il17a gene.
Discussion
In this study, we examined the role of IL-2 in Th17 generation and found that this cytokine appears to negatively regulate IL-17 production in vivo and in vitro. Il2−/− mice have widespread autoimmune disease, which has been attributed to impaired Treg cell development and/or function. Overproduction of IL-17 is a common feature of many autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, and dysregulation of IL-17 was a previously unappreciated aspect of autoimmunity associated with IL-2 deficiency. The inflammatory effects associated with overproduction of this cytokine help to explain the severe, systemic disease in Il2−/− mice. It will be of interest in the future to determine to what extent the pathology in these mice is IL-17 dependent.
Because of the systemic abnormalities associated with Il2−/− deficiency, we considered the possibility that the overproduction of IL-17 might be a secondary manifestation of disease and potentially not directly due to IL-2 itself. However, we also noted enhanced IL-17 production in TCR transgenic, IL-2-deficient mice that did not have autoimmune disease. Moreover, by using adoptive transfer experiments, we observed increased propensity of IL-2-deficient T cells to become IL-17 producers during a normal vaccination response. Thus, even in the context of normal numbers of Treg cells and without addition of exogenous cytokines or cytokine antibodies, the capacity of T cells to produce IL-2 regulated IL-17 production. This is not to say that in the context of autoimmunity other mechanisms might also contribute to IL-17 dysregulation; however, we believe that the present data argue that IL-2 is a relevant physiologic regulator of Th17 differentiation independent of autoimmune disease. Our data suggest a model in which IL-2, acting via STAT5, attenuates overproduction of IL-17, which in addition to its positive effects on Treg cells provides another mechanism to constrain immune-mediated damage to the host.
Recently, TGF-β1 has been implicated in the peripheral induction of both Treg and Th17 cells ([Bettelli et al., 2006], [Veldhoen et al., 2006a] and [Veldhoen et al., 2006b]). Whereas TGF-β1 is evidently important for both lineages in vitro, this cytokine clearly does not selectively direct lineage commitment; rather, the additional stimulus from proinflammatory cytokines produced by dendritic cells including IL-6 and IL-23 are needed. These cytokines activate STAT3 to direct and maintain Th17 differentiation. In this regard, it is notable that reduction in STAT3 levels resulted in impaired Th17 differentiation. Previous studies from our laboratory have documented direct binding of STAT3 to the Il17a promoter, suggesting a direct role in transcriptional regulation.
In contrast to IL-6 and IL-23, IL-2 provides a counterregulatory mechanism that promotes Treg differentiation and FoxP3 expression while concomitantly antagonizing Th17 polarization. In this regard, it is worth noting that Treg cells reportedly stimulate Th17 differentiation in vitro via TGF-β1 production (Veldhoen et al., 2006a) but can also inhibit IL-2 production (Thornton and Shevach, 1998), which could also promote Th17 polarization. IL-2 preferentially activates STAT5, and in contrast to STAT3, STAT5 appears to negatively regulate IL-17 production. Like Il2−/− mice, Stat5−/− mice have widespread autoimmune disease ([Antov et al., 2003] and [Snow et al., 2003]). This has been attributed to impaired Treg cells, but STAT5-deficient CD4+ T cells also exhibit dysregulation of IL-17, which may be another contributor to the pathology in these mice. While the overproduction of IL-17 secondarily might also be related to loss of Treg cells, autoimmunity, or the memory phenotype of the CD4+ T cells, we found that naive STAT5-deficient CD4+ SP thymocytes also had increased propensity to become IL-17 producers, and IL-2-dependent inhibition of Th17 generation was blocked. Furthermore, STAT5 was found to bind the Il17a promoter, suggesting that in contrast to STAT3, it could serve as a repressor. This is of interest in that other cytokines, which activate other STAT family transcription factors, can also inhibit IL-17 production. Specifically, IL-4 (which primarily activates STAT6) and IFN-γ and IL-27 (which activate STAT1) all inhibit IL-17 production ([Batten et al., 2006], [Harrington et al., 2005] and [Stumhofer et al., 2006]). We have also observed binding of STAT1 and STAT6 to the Il17a promoter (data not shown). This raises the intriguing possibility that different STAT family members can recruit different coactivators or regulators of chromatin modification. It will therefore be important to determine precisely how different STAT family members might positively and negatively IL17 transcription. Alternatively, although STAT family transcription factors have the potential to serve as direct repressors of Il17a, they may also have indirect effects. 
<*>For instance, STATs regulate Socs3, which in turn also regulates Th17 cell differentiation (Chen et al., 2006) //Can't find anything about stat -> socs in chen.
Additionally, the actions of STAT3 and 5 may occur via RORγt. Thus, STATs may have both direct and indirect modes of regulating IL-17 production.
In summary, IL-2 and STAT5a/b, which were known to be key regulators of Treg cells, also serve to constrain Th17 polarization. It is notable that a major cytokine, which promotes clonal expansion, curtails the generation of a highly inflammatory T cell subset. We envision the role of IL-2 as another means of limiting inflammation that might occur during immune responses. Homeostasis of both lineages, Treg and Th17 cells, by IL-2 can ensure that immune responses do not inflict damage to host tissues. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which cytokines and STAT family transcription factors regulate these lineages will certainly be of continuing interest.
