TI  - Toll-like receptor 2 signaling protects mice from tumor development in a
      mouse model of colitis-induced cancer.
PG  - e13027
LID - e13027 [pii]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disorder of chronic inflammation
      with increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer. The etiology of IBD is
      unclear but thought to result from a dysregulated adaptive and innate
      immune response to microbial products in a genetically susceptible host.
      Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling induced by intestinal commensal
      bacteria plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis,
      innate immunity and the enhancement of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)
      integrity. However, the role of TLR2 in the development of colorectal
      cancer has not been studied. We utilized the AOM-DSS model for
      colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) in wild type (WT) and TLR2(-/-)
      mice. Colons harvested from WT and TLR2(-/-) mice were used for
      histopathology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and cytokine
      analysis. Mice deficient in TLR2 developed significantly more and larger
      colorectal tumors than their WT controls. We provide evidence that colonic
      epithelium of TLR2(-/-) mice have altered immune responses and
      dysregulated proliferation under steady-state conditions and during
      colitis, which lead to inflammatory growth signals and predisposition to
      accelerated neoplastic growth. At the earliest time-points assessed,
      TLR2(-/-) colons exhibited a significant increase in aberrant crypt foci
      (ACF), resulting in tumors that developed earlier and grew larger. In
      addition, the intestinal microenvironment revealed significantly higher
      levels of IL-6 and IL-17A concomitant with increased phospho-STAT3 within
      ACF. These observations indicate that in colitis, TLR2 plays a protective
      role against the development of CAC.

TI  - Preferential inhibition of the mRNA expression of p38 MAPK regulated
      cytokines in psoriatic skin by anti-TNFalpha therapy.
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.10036.x [doi]
AB  - Background  Anti-TNFalpha therapies are well established for severe
      psoriasis. Their mechanism of action in disease resolution is, however,
      not fully understood. p38 MAPK is a kinase known to play a key role in the
      pathogenesis of psoriasis. Objective  To elucidate the early effects of
      adalimumab, a human monoclonal anti-TNFalpha antibody, on the expression
      of interleukins in psoriatic skin. Patients/Methods  Biopsies from
      psoriatic patients were examined before and after the onset of adalimumab
      therapy. Quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA expression of
      cytokines. p38 MAPK and STAT3 were analysed by Western blotting and
      immunofluorescence analyses, whereas immunohistochemistry was used to
      examine IL-17A and IL-17C. Results  The increased mRNA level of IL-1beta,
      IL-8, IL-17C and IL-20 in lesional psoriatic skin was significantly
      reduced already 4 days after start of adalimumab treatment, i.e. before
      clinical and histological improvement was detectable. The mRNA expression
      of the Th17 derived cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 as well as the
      dendritic cell product IL-23/IL-12 (p40) were not significantly reduced
      until 2 weeks after start of treatment, whereas the mRNA expression of
      IL-23 (p19) and the Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2 were reduced late in
      disease resolution. IL-1beta, IL-8 and IL-20 are all known to be regulated
      by p38 MAPK. IL-17C was produced by cultured human keratinocytes and this
      production was also mediated by a p38 MAPK dependent mechanism. Moreover,
      the early effects of adalimumab included the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK,
      but not STAT3 phosphorylation. Conclusions  This study indicates that an
      important mechanism of action of anti-TNFalpha therapy in psoriasis is a
      reduction in p38 MAPK phosphorylation and a subsequent decrease in the
      expression of p38 MAPK regulated genes.

TI  - Interleukin 6 in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases: a personal memoir.
PG  - 717-30
AB  - In this review, the author discusses the research that led to the
      identification and characterization of interleukin 6 (IL-6), including his
      own experience isolating IL-6, and the roles this cytokine has on
      autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The cDNAs encoding B-cell
      stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2), interferon (IFN)-beta2 and a 26-kDa protein
      were independently cloned in 1986, which in turn led to the identification
      of each. To resolve the confusing nomenclature, these identical molecules
      were named IL-6. Characterization of IL-6 revealed a multifunctional
      cytokine that is involved in not only immune responses but also
      hematopoiesis, inflammation, and bone metabolism. Moreover, IL-6 makes
      significant contributions to such autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).IL-6 activates both the STAT3 and SHP2/Gab/MAPK
      signaling pathways via the gp130 signal transducer. F759 mice, which
      contain a single amino-acid substitution in gp130 (Y759F) and show
      enhanced STAT3 activation, spontaneously develop a RA-like arthritis as
      they age. F759 arthritis is dependent on CD4(+) T cells, IL-6, and IL-17A,
      and is enhanced by the pX gene product from human T cell leukemia virus 1
      (HTLV-1). Arthritis development in these mice requires that the F759
      mutation is present in nonhematopoietic cells, but not in immune cells,
      highlighting the important role of the interaction between nonimmune
      tissues and the immune system in this disease. Furthermore, this
      interaction is mediated by the IL-6 amplifier through STAT3 and NF-kappaB.
      Ultimately, this model may represent a general etiologic process
      underlying other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. More importantly,
      the understanding of IL-6 has paved the way for new therapeutic approaches
      for RA and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Inborn errors of mucocutaneous immunity to Candida albicans in humans: a
      role for IL-17 cytokines?
PG  - 467-74
AB  - The various clinical manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
      (CMC) often result from acquired T-cell immunodeficiencies. More rarely,
      CMC results from inborn errors of immunity, the recent dissection of which
      has shed light on the molecular mechanisms of mucocutaneous immunity to
      Candida albicans. CMC may accompany various other infectious diseases in
      patients with almost any broad and profound T-cell primary
      immunodeficiency. By contrast, CMC is one of the few key infections in
      patients with autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (mutations in STAT3),
      and in rare patients with autosomal recessive predisposition to
      mucocutaneous and invasive fungal infections (mutation in CARD9). In
      patients with mutations in STAT3 and CARD9, the development of
      IL-17-producing T cells is impaired. Moreover, CMC is the principal, if
      not only, infection in patients with autosomal recessive autoimmune
      polyendocrinopathy syndrome-I (mutations in AIRE). Patients with this
      condition have high titers of neutralizing autoantibodies (auto-Abs)
      against the IL-17 cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. Collectively, these
      data suggest that human IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 are essential for
      mucocutaneous immunity to C. albicans. They also suggest that the distinct
      syndrome of isolated CMC, without auto-immunity or other infections, may
      be caused by inborn errors of IL-17 immunity.

TI  - Role of osteopontin in synovial Th17 differentiation in rheumatoid
      arthritis.
PG  - 2900-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteopontin (OPN) that is aberrantly produced in rheumatoid
      synovium is thought to play an important role in rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). This study was undertaken to investigate the role of OPN in the
      differentiation and accumulation of Th17 cells in rheumatoid synovium.
      METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified CD4+ T cells
      derived from patients with RA or healthy controls were used to test the
      effect of OPN in vitro. Cytokine expression was determined by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction. Intracellular staining and flow cytometry were used to detect
      the percentages of Th17 cells and OPN receptors. Signaling and molecular
      events were analyzed by immunoblotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation.
      RESULTS: The levels of OPN correlated significantly with interleukin-17
      (IL-17) production and the frequency of Th17 cells in the synovial fluid
      (SF) of RA patients. Endogenous OPN produced in RA SF was responsible for
      markedly increased production of IL-17 in T cells, which was blocked by
      OPN antibody. The effect of OPN in Th17 differentiation was mediated
      through a mechanism independent of the IL-6/STAT-3 pathway or other
      cytokines and specifically involved the OPN receptors CD44 and CD29 and
      the transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR).
      Furthermore, OPN was found to induce H3 acetylation of the IL17A gene
      promoter, mainly through the CD44 binding domain in CD4+ T cells, allowing
      the interaction of the IL17A gene locus with ROR. CONCLUSION: This study
      reveals new evidence of the critical role of OPN in Th17 differentiation
      in rheumatoid synovitis.

TI  - Redundant and pathogenic roles for IL-22 in mycobacterial, protozoan, and
      helminth infections.
PG  - 4378-90
AB  - IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family and signals through a
      heterodimeric receptor composed of the common IL-10R2 subunit and the
      IL-22R subunit. IL-10 and IL-22 both activate the STAT3 signaling pathway;
      however, in contrast to IL-10, relatively little is known about IL-22 in
      the host response to infection. In this study, using IL-22(-/-) mice,
      neutralizing Abs to IL-22, or both, we show that IL-22 is dispensable for
      the development of immunity to the opportunistic pathogens Toxoplasma
      gondii and Mycobacterium avium when administered via the i.p. or i.v.
      route, respectively. IL-22 also played little to no role in aerosol
      infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in granuloma formation and
      hepatic fibrosis following chronic percutaneous infections with the
      helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni. A marked pathogenic role for IL-22
      was, however, identified in toxoplasmosis when infections were established
      by the natural oral route. Anti-IL-22 Ab-treated mice developed
      significantly less intestinal pathology than control Ab-treated mice even
      though both groups displayed similar parasite burdens. The decreased gut
      pathology was associated with reduced IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF-alpha, and
      IFN-gamma expression. In contrast to the prior observations of IL-22
      protective effects in the gut, these distinct findings with oral T. gondii
      infection demonstrate that IL-22 also has the potential to contribute to
      pathogenic inflammation in the intestine. The IL-22 pathway has emerged as
      a possible target for control of inflammation in certain autoimmune
      diseases. Our findings suggest that few if any infectious complications
      would be expected with the suppression of IL-22 signaling.

TI  - Evidence for altered activity of the IL-6 pathway in chronic
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
PG  - 397-403.e10
AB  - BACKGROUND: IL-6 activates T(H)17 cells and regulates the response of B
      lymphocytes and regulatory T cells. The IL-6 receptor and the membrane
      protein, glycoprotein 130 (gp130), form an active signaling complex that
      signals through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
      and other signaling molecules. Both the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and gp130
      can be found in soluble forms that regulate the pathway. OBJECTIVE: We
      measured IL-6 signaling components and IL-17 in chronic rhinosinusitis
      (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and
      controls to assess the IL-6 pathway in CRS. METHODS: IL-6, soluble IL-6R,
      soluble gp130 (sgp130), and IL-17 were measured in sinus tissue extracts
      and in nasal lavage fluid by either cytokine bead array or ELISA.
      phosphoSTAT3 (p-STAT3) was determined by Western blot and by
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: IL-6 protein was significantly (P < .001)
      increased in CRSwNP compared with CRSsNP and controls. Soluble IL-6R was
      also increased in nasal polyp compared with control tissue (P < .01).
      Despite elevated IL-6 and sIL-6R, IL-17A, E, and F were undetectable in
      the sinus tissue from most of the patients with CRS and controls. p-STAT3
      levels were reduced in the polyp tissue, possibly indicating reduced
      activity of IL-6 in the tissue. sgp130 was elevated in CRSwNP compared
      with CRSsNP and controls. CONCLUSION: p-STAT3 levels are decreased in
      CRSwNP despite increased levels of IL-6 and sIL-6R and are associated with
      the absence of an IL-17 response. This may be a response to elevated
      levels of sgp130, a known inhibitor of IL-6 signaling. These results
      indicate that IL-6 and its signaling pathway may be altered in CRSwNP.

TI  - Circulating Th17, Th22, and Th1 cells are increased in psoriasis.
PG  - 1373-83
AB  - Th17, Th22, and Th1 cells are detected in psoriatic skin lesions and
      implicated in psoriasis pathogenesis, but inflammatory T cell numbers in
      blood, as well as the relative importance of each cell type, is unclear.
      Using 7-color flow cytometry, circulating Th17, Th22, and Th1 cells were
      quantified in 21 untreated psoriatics and 17 healthy individuals. CCR6 was
      the best cell surface marker for IL-17A+ cells when compared with IL-23R
      or CD161. CCR6+, IL-17A+, IL-22+, CCR6+IL-17A+, CCR6+IL-22+, CCR6+tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha+, IL-17A+IFN-gamma-, IL-17A+IL-22+IFN-gamma-, and
      IL-17A+IL-22-IFN-gamma- cells were increased in psoriatics (all values
      P<0.001), indicating elevations in circulating Th17 cells, using multiple
      criteria to define these cells. Th22 (IL-17A-IL-22+IFN-gamma-, P<0.05) and
      Th1 (IL-17A-IFN-gamma+, P<0.05) cells were also increased in psoriatics,
      but to a lesser extent. Inhibition of either NF-kappaB or STAT3 in vitro
      blocked cytokine production by both Th17 and Th1 cells. Circulating levels
      of Th17 and Th1 cells decreased in a subset of five psoriasis patients
      serially evaluated following induction therapy with infliximab. In
      summary, elevated numbers of circulating inflammatory T cells may
      contribute to cutaneous inflammation and systemic inflammatory disease
      that occurs in individuals with psoriasis.

TI  - Natural occurring IL-17 producing T cells regulate the initial phase of
      neutrophil mediated airway responses.
PG  - 7523-30
AB  - Effector Th17 cells are a major source of IL-17, a critical inflammatory
      cytokine in autoimmune diseases and in host defenses during bacterial
      infections. Recently, splenic lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells have been
      reported to be a source of T cell independent IL-17. In this study, we
      report that the immune system contains a unique set of natural occurring
      IL-17 producing cell, "natural" Th17 (nTh17), which are a memory-like T
      cell subset. The nTh17 cells can develop in the absence of the IL-6/STAT3
      signaling axis required by inducible Th17 cells. The nTh17 cell population
      is distinct from conventional inducible Th17 cells, since nTh17 cells
      express substantial amounts of IL-17A (IL-17), but not IL-17F, under the
      control of the master regulator, RORgammat. The nTh17 cells simultaneously
      produce IFN-gamma. DO11.10 transgenic mice with a Rag(-/-) background
      (DO11.10 Rag(-/-)) lack nTh17 cells, and, following intranasal
      administration of OVA, IL-17-dependent neutrophil infiltration occurs in
      DO11.10 transgenic mice, but not in DO11.10 Rag(-/-) mice. The impaired
      neutrophil-dependent airway response is restored by adaptive transfer of
      nTh17 cells into DO11.10 Rag(-/-) mice. These results demonstrate that a
      novel T cell subset, nTh17, facilitates the early phase of Ag-induced
      airway responses and host defenses against pathogen invasion before the
      establishment of acquired immunity.

TI  - IFN-beta inhibits human Th17 cell differentiation.
PG  - 5418-27
AB  - IFN-beta-1a has been used over the past 15 years as a primary therapy for
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the immunomodulatory
      mechanisms that provide a therapeutic effect against this CNS inflammatory
      disease are not yet completely elucidated. The effect of IFN-beta-1a on
      Th17 cells, which play a critical role in the development of the
      autoimmune response, has not been extensively studied in humans. We have
      investigated the effect of IFN-beta-1a on dendritic cells (DCs) and naive
      CD4(+)CD45RA(+) T cells derived from untreated MS patients and healthy
      controls in the context of Th17 cell differentiation. We report that
      IFN-beta-1a treatment down-regulated the expression of IL-1beta and
      IL-23p19 in DCs, whereas it induced the gene expression of IL-12p35 and
      IL-27p28. We propose that IFN-beta-1a-mediated up-regulation of the
      suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression, induced via STAT3
      phosphorylation, mediates IL-1beta and IL-23 down-regulation, while
      IFN-beta-1a-induced STAT1 phosphorylation induces IL-27p28 expression.
      CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells cocultured with supernatants from
      IFN-beta-1a-treated DCs exhibited decreased gene expression of the Th17
      cell markers retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear hormone receptor c
      (RORc), IL-17A, and IL-23R. A direct IFN-beta-1a treatment of CD45RA(+) T
      cells cultured in Th17-polarizing conditions also down-regulated RORc,
      IL-17A, and IL-23R, but up-regulated IL-10 gene expression. Studies of the
      mechanisms involved in the Th17 cell differentiation suggest that
      IFN-beta-1a inhibits IL-17 and induces IL-10 secretion via activated STAT1
      and STAT3, respectively. IFN-beta's suppression of Th17 cell
      differentiation may represent its most relevant mechanism of selective
      suppression of the autoimmune response in MS.

TI  - Induction of Th17 differentiation by corneal epithelial-derived cytokines.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - This study was to explore a potential role of epithelium-derived cytokines
      in Th17 differentiation. Th17 induction was evaluated by murine CD4(+) T
      cells treated with different combinations of five inducing cytokines, or
      conditioned media of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) exposed to a
      variety of stimuli. Th17 differentiation was determined by measuring Th17
      associated molecules, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, CCL-20, and STAT3 at mRNA and
      protein levels, and numbers of IL-17-producing T cells by real-time PCR,
      and cytokine immunobead and ELISPOT assays, respectively. IL-23 was the
      strongest inducer for expanding Th17 cells in the presence of TGF-beta1 +
      IL-6; and IL-1beta was the strongest Th17 amplifier in the presence of
      TGF-beta1 + IL-6 + IL-23. These inducing cytokines were found to be
      significantly stimulated in HCECs challenged by hyperosmotic media (450
      mOsM), microbial components (polyI:C, flagellin, R837, and other TLR
      ligands) and TNF-alpha. Interestingly, when incubated with conditioned
      media of HCECs irritated by polyI:C or TNF-alpha, CD4(+) T cells displayed
      increased mRNA levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, CCL-20, and STAT3,
      increased IL-17 protein in the supernatant, and increased numbers of
      IL-17-producing T cells (Th17 cells). These findings demonstrate for the
      first time that Th17 differentiation can be promoted by cytokines produced
      by corneal epithelium that are exposed to hyperosmotic, microbial, and
      inflammatory stimuli.

TI  - IL-1 family members and STAT activators induce cytokine production by Th2,
      Th17, and Th1 cells.
PG  - 13463-8
AB  - Expression of T1ST2, the IL-33R, by Th2 cells requires GATA3. Resting Th2
      cells express little GATA3, which is increased by IL-33 and a STAT5
      activator, in turn increasing T1ST2 from its low-level expression on
      resting Th2 cells. Th2 cells that have upregulated T1ST2 produce IL-13,
      but not IL-4, in response to IL-33 plus a STAT5 activator in an
      antigen-independent, NF-kappaB-dependent, cyclosporin A (CsA)-resistant
      manner. Similarly, Th17 cells produce IL-17A in response to IL-1beta and a
      STAT3 activator and Th1 cells produce IFNgamma in response to IL-18 and a
      STAT4 inducer. Thus, each effector Th cell produces cytokines without
      antigenic stimulation in response to an IL-1 family member and a specific
      STAT activator, implying an innate mechanism through which memory CD4 T
      cells are recruited by an induced cytokine environment.

TI  - Crohn's disease: Th1, Th17 or both? The change of a paradigm: new
      immunological and genetic insights implicate Th17 cells in the
      pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1152-67
AB  - Traditionally, Crohn's disease has been associated with a Th1 cytokine
      profile, while Th2 cytokines are modulators of ulcerative colitis. This
      concept has been challenged by the description of tolerising regulatory T
      cells (Treg) and by proinflammatory Th17 cells, a novel T cell population
      characterised by the master transcription factor RORgammat, the surface
      markers IL23R and CCR6, and by production of the proinflammatory cytokines
      IL17A, IL17F, IL21, IL22 and IL26, and the chemokine CCL20. Th17 cells
      differentiate under the influence of IL1beta, IL6, IL21 and IL23. Recent
      studies indicate that TGFbeta is essential not only for the development of
      murine Th17 cells but also for differentiation of human Th17 cells.
      TGFbeta reciprocally regulates the differentiation of inflammatory Th17
      cells and suppressive Treg subsets, with the concomitant presence of
      proinflammatory cytokines favouring Th17 cell differentiation. Several
      studies demonstrated an important role of Th17 cells in intestinal
      inflammation, particularly in Crohn's disease. Genome-wide association
      studies indicate that IL23R and five additional genes involved in Th17
      differentiation (IL12B, JAK2, STAT3, CCR6 and TNFSF15) are associated with
      susceptibility to Crohn's disease and partly also to ulcerative colitis.
      Taken together, both Th1 and Th17 cells are important mediators of
      inflammation in Crohn's disease, although activities previously ascribed
      to IL12 may be mediated by IL23. Anti-IL12/IL23p40 antibody therapy, which
      targets both Th1 and Th17 cells, is effective in Crohn's disease. However,
      the complex relationship between Th1 and Th17 cells has not been
      completely analysed. This will be of great importance to delineate the
      specific contributions of these cells to Crohn's disease and other
      autoimmune diseases.

TI  - IL-17 can promote tumor growth through an IL-6-Stat3 signaling pathway.
PG  - 1457-64
AB  - Although the Th17 subset and its signature cytokine, interleukin (IL)-17A
      (IL-17), are implicated in certain autoimmune diseases, their role in
      cancer remains to be further explored. IL-17 has been shown to be elevated
      in several types of cancer, but how it might contribute to tumor growth is
      still unclear. We show that growth of B16 melanoma and MB49 bladder
      carcinoma is reduced in IL-17(-/-) mice but drastically accelerated in
      IFN-gamma(-/-) mice, contributed to by elevated intratumoral IL-17,
      indicating a role of IL-17 in promoting tumor growth. Adoptive transfer
      studies and analysis of the tumor microenvironment suggest that CD4(+) T
      cells are the predominant source of IL-17. Enhancement of tumor growth by
      IL-17 involves direct effects on tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal
      cells, which bear IL-17 receptors. IL-17 induces IL-6 production, which in
      turn activates oncogenic signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (Stat) 3, up-regulating prosurvival and proangiogenic genes. The Th17
      response can thus promote tumor growth, in part via an IL-6-Stat3 pathway.

TI  - Expression of IL-24, an activator of the JAK1/STAT3/SOCS3 cascade, is
      enhanced in inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 687-95
AB  - IL-24 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines. In this study, we
      investigated IL-24 expression in the inflamed mucosa of patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and characterized the molecular
      mechanisms responsible for IL-24 expression in human colonic subepithelial
      myofibroblasts (SEMFs). IL-24 expression in the IBD mucosa was evaluated
      by immunohistochemical methods. IL-24 mRNA and protein expression was
      determined by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. AP-1 and C/EBP
      DNA-binding activity and IL-24 promoter activity were assessed by EMSA
      analysis and a reporter gene assay, respectively. IL-24 mRNA expression
      was significantly elevated in active lesions from patients who have
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Colonic SEMFs were identified as a
      major source of IL-24 in the mucosa. IL-1beta, but not IL-17A, TNF-alpha,
      or IFN-gamma, significantly enhanced IL-24 mRNA and protein expression in
      isolated colonic SEMFs. The IL-1beta-induced IL-24 mRNA expression was
      mediated by the activation of the transcription factors, AP-1 and
      C/EBP-beta. Induction of IL-24 mRNA stabilization was also involved in the
      effects of IL-1beta. IL-24 induced JAK1/STAT-3 phosphorylation and SOCS3
      expression in HT-29 colonic epithelial cells. IL-24 did not modulate the
      proliferation of HT-29 cells, but significantly increased the mRNA
      expression of membrane-bound mucins (MUC1, MUC3, and MUC4). IL-24 derived
      from colonic SEMFs acts on colonic epithelial cells to elicit JAK1/STAT-3
      activation and the expression of SOCS3 and mucins, supporting their
      suppressive effects on mucosal inflammation in IBD.

TI  - Critical role for STAT3 in IL-17A-mediated CCL11 expression in human
      airway smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 3357-65
AB  - IL-17A has been shown to be expressed at higher levels in respiratory
      secretions from asthmatics and to correlate with airway
      hyperresponsiveness. Although these studies raise the possibility that
      IL-17A may influence allergic disease, the mechanism remains unknown. We
      previously demonstrated that IL-17A mediates CC chemokine (CCL11)
      production from human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. In this study, we
      demonstrate that STAT3 activation is critical in IL-17A-mediated CCL11
      expression in ASM cells. IL-17A mediated a rapid phosphorylation of STAT3
      but not STAT6 or STAT5 in ASM cells. Interestingly, transient transfection
      with wild-type or mutated CCL11 promoter constructs showed that
      IL-17A-mediated CCL11 expression relies on the STAT6 binding site.
      However, STAT3 but not STAT6 in vivo binding to the CCL11 promoter was
      detected following IL-17A stimulation of ASM cells. Overexpression of DN
      STAT3 (STAT3beta) abolishes IL-17A-induced CCL11 promoter activity. This
      effect was not observed with STAT6 DN or the STAT3 mutant at Ser(727).
      Interestingly, disruption of STAT3 activity with the SH2 domain binding
      peptide, but not with control peptide, results in a significant reduction
      of IL-17A-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and CCL11 promoter activity.
      IL-17A-mediated CCL11 promoter activity and mRNA were significantly
      diminished in STAT3- but not STAT6-silenced ASM cells. Finally,
      IL-17A-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was sensitive to pharmacological
      inhibitors of JAK2 and ERK1/2. Taken together, our data provide the first
      evidence of IL-17A-mediated gene expression via STAT3 in ASM cells.
      Collectively, our results raise the possibility that the IL-17A/STAT3
      signaling pathway may play a crucial role in airway inflammatory
      responses.

TI  - Therapeutic targeting of IL-6 trans signaling counteracts STAT3 control of
      experimental inflammatory arthritis.
PG  - 613-22
AB  - Cytokine control of the synovial infiltrate is a central process in the
      development of inflammatory arthritis. In this study, we combine genetic
      approaches and intervention strategies to describe a fundamental
      requirement for IL-6-mediated STAT3 signaling in orchestrating the
      inflammatory infiltrate in monoarticular and systemic models of
      experimental arthritis. STAT3 activation via the common gp130
      signal-transducing receptor for all IL-6-related cytokines led to
      increased retention of neutrophils and T cells within the inflamed
      synovium, which included STAT3-regulated IL-17A-secreting T cells. Control
      of leukocyte infiltration was reliant upon IL-6 signaling via its soluble
      receptor (termed IL-6 trans signaling), as evidenced by selective blockade
      of this alternative IL-6 signaling pathway using an engineered variant of
      soluble gp130 (sgp130Fc). This therapeutic intervention led to substantial
      clinical improvement in mice with emerging or established incidence of
      systemic arthritis. These data illustrate that IL-6 control of STAT3 is
      critical for regulating the synovial infiltrate in inflammatory arthritis,
      and suggest that selective inhibition of IL-6 trans signaling may provide
      a more refined intervention strategy for blocking IL-6-driven proarthritic
      activities.

TI  - Interleukin-17 promotes autoimmunity by triggering a positive-feedback
      loop via interleukin-6 induction.
PG  - 628-36
AB  - Dysregulated cytokine expression and signaling are major contributors to a
      number of autoimmune diseases. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-6 are
      important in many disorders characterized by immune self-recognition, and
      IL-6 is known to induce the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells.
      Here we described an IL-17A-triggered positive-feedback loop of IL-6
      signaling, which involved the activation of the transcription factors
      nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) in fibroblasts. Importantly, enhancement of this
      loop caused by disruption of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3
      (SOCS3)-dependent negative regulation of the IL-6 signal transducer gp130
      contributed to the development of arthritis. Because this mechanism also
      enhanced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in wild-type
      mice, it may be a general etiologic process underlying other Th17
      cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.

TI  - IL-17A induces eotaxin-1/CC chemokine ligand 11 expression in human airway
      smooth muscle cells: role of MAPK (Erk1/2, JNK, and p38) pathways.
PG  - 4064-71
AB  - Recently, IL-17A has been shown to be expressed in higher levels in
      respiratory secretions from asthmatics and correlated with airway
      hyperresponsiveness. Although these studies raise the possibility that
      IL-17A may influence allergic disease, the mechanisms remain unknown. In
      this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in
      IL-17A-mediated CC chemokine (eotaxin-1/CCL11) production from human
      airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. We found that incubation of human ASM
      cells with rIL-17A resulted in a significant increase of eotaxin-1/CCL11
      release from ASM cells that was reduced by neutralizing anti-IL-17A mAb.
      Moreover, IL-17A significantly induced eotaxin-1/CCL11 release and mRNA
      expression, an effect that was abrogated with cycloheximide and
      actinomycin D treatment. Furthermore, transfection studies using a
      luciferase-driven reporter construct containing eotaxin-1/CCL11 proximal
      promoter showed that IL-17A induced eotaxin-1/CCL11 at the transcriptional
      level. IL-17A also enhanced significantly IL-1beta-mediated
      eotaxin-1/CCL11 mRNA, protein release, and promoter activity in ASM cells.
      Primary human ASM cells pretreated with inhibitors of MAPK p38, p42/p44
      ERK, JNK, or JAK but not PI3K, showed a significant decrease in
      eotaxin-1/CCL11 release upon IL-17A treatment. In addition, IL-17A
      mediated rapid phosphorylation of MAPK (p38, JNK, and p42/44 ERK) and
      STAT-3 but not STAT-6 or STAT-5 in ASM cells. Taken together, our data
      provide the first evidence of IL-17A-induced eotaxin-1/CCL11 expression in
      ASM cells via MAPK (p38, p42/p44 ERK, JNK) signaling pathways. Our results
      raise the possibility that IL-17A may play a role in allergic asthma by
      inducing eotaxin-1/CCL11 production.

TI  - Selective regulatory function of Socs3 in the formation of IL-17-secreting
      T cells.
PG  - 8137-42
AB  - Suppressor of cytokine signaling (Socs) 3 is a cytokine-inducible
      inhibitor with critical but selective cell-specific effects. We show that
      deficiency of Socs3 in T cells had minimal effects on differentiation of T
      cells to the T helper (Th) 1 or Th2 subsets; accordingly, Socs3 had no
      effect on IL-12-dependent signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (Stat) 4 phosphorylation or IL-4-dependent Stat6 phosphorylation. By
      contrast, Socs3 was found to be a major regulator of IL-23-mediated Stat3
      phosphorylation and Th17 generation, and Stat3 directly binds to the
      IL-17A and IL-17F promoters. We conclude that Socs3 is an essential
      negative regulator of IL-23 signaling, inhibition of which constrains the
      generation of Th17 differentiation.
