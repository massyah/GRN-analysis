TI  - Role of conserved non-coding DNA elements in the Foxp3 gene in regulatory
      T-cell fate.
PG  - 808-12
AB  - Immune homeostasis is dependent on tight control over the size of a
      population of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells capable of suppressing
      over-exuberant immune responses. The T(reg) cell subset is comprised of
      cells that commit to the T(reg) lineage by upregulating the transcription
      factor Foxp3 either in the thymus (tT(reg)) or in the periphery (iT(reg)).
      Considering a central role for Foxp3 in T(reg) cell differentiation and
      function, we proposed that conserved non-coding DNA sequence (CNS)
      elements at the Foxp3 locus encode information defining the size,
      composition and stability of the T(reg) cell population. Here we describe
      the function of three Foxp3 CNS elements (CNS1-3) in T(reg) cell fate
      determination in mice. The pioneer element CNS3, which acts to potently
      increase the frequency of T(reg) cells generated in the thymus and the
      periphery, binds c-Rel in in vitro assays. In contrast, CNS1, which
      contains a TGF-beta-NFAT response element, is superfluous for tT(reg) cell
      differentiation, but has a prominent role in iT(reg) cell generation in
      gut-associated lymphoid tissues. CNS2, although dispensable for Foxp3
      induction, is required for Foxp3 expression in the progeny of dividing
      T(reg) cells. Foxp3 binds to CNS2 in a Cbf-beta-Runx1 and CpG DNA
      demethylation-dependent manner, suggesting that Foxp3 recruitment to this
      'cellular memory module' facilitates the heritable maintenance of the
      active state of the Foxp3 locus and, therefore, T(reg) lineage stability.
      Together, our studies demonstrate that the composition, size and
      maintenance of the T(reg) cell population are controlled by Foxp3 CNS
      elements engaged in response to distinct cell-extrinsic or -intrinsic
      cues.

TI  - Three distinct domains contribute to nuclear transport of murine Foxp3.
PG  - e7890
AB  - Foxp3, a 47-kDa transcription factor, is necessary for the function of
      CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), with an essential role in the
      control of self-reactive T cells and in preventing autoimmunity.
      Activation of Tregs by TCR engagement results in upregulation of Foxp3
      expression, followed by its rapid nuclear transport and binding to
      chromatin. Here, we identify three distinct Foxp3 domains that contribute
      to nuclear transport. The first domain (Domain 1) comprises the C-terminal
      12 amino acids. The second domain (Domain 2) is located immediately
      N-terminal to the forkhead domain (FHD), recently reported to be a binding
      site for the runt-related transcription factor 1/acute myeloid leukemia 1
      (Runx1/AML1). The third domain (Domain 3) is located within the N-terminal
      first 51 amino acids. Unlike the known nuclear localization signals
      (NLSs), none of these three regions are rich in basic residues and do not
      bear any similarity to known monopartite or bipartite NLSs that have one
      or more clusters of basic amino acids. The basic
      arginine-lysine-lysine-arginine (RKKR) sequence, located 12-aa from the
      C-terminal end of Foxp3 was previously reported to be a nuclear
      localization signal (NLS) for several proteins, including for a GFP-Foxp3
      hybrid. Evidence is provided here that in the full-length native Foxp3
      RKKR does not function as an NLS. The data reported in this study
      indicates that Foxp3 achieves nuclear transport by binding to other
      nuclear factors and co-transporting with them to the nucleus.

TI  - Transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3 in the induction and suppressive
      function of Foxp3+ inducible regulatory T cells.
PG  - 2701-15
AB  - Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) inducible regulatory T (iT reg)
      cells play an important role in immune tolerance and homeostasis. In this
      study, we show that the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces
      the expression of the Runt-related transcription factors RUNX1 and RUNX3
      in CD4(+) T cells. This induction seems to be a prerequisite for the
      binding of RUNX1 and RUNX3 to three putative RUNX binding sites in the
      FOXP3 promoter. Inactivation of the gene encoding RUNX cofactor
      core-binding factor-beta (CBFbeta) in mice and small interfering RNA
      (siRNA)-mediated suppression of RUNX1 and RUNX3 in human T cells resulted
      in reduced expression of Foxp3. The in vivo conversion of naive CD4(+) T
      cells into Foxp3(+) iT reg cells was significantly decreased in adoptively
      transferred Cbfb(F/F) CD4-cre naive T cells into Rag2(-/-) mice. Both
      RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA silenced human T reg cells and Cbfb(F/F) CD4-cre
      mouse T reg cells showed diminished suppressive function in vitro.
      Circulating human CD4(+) CD25(high) CD127(-) T reg cells significantly
      expressed higher levels of RUNX3, FOXP3, and TGF-beta mRNA compared with
      CD4(+)CD25(-) cells. Furthermore, FOXP3 and RUNX3 were colocalized in
      human tonsil T reg cells. These data demonstrate Runx transcription
      factors as a molecular link in TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 expression in iT reg
      cell differentiation and function.

TI  - Indispensable role of the Runx1-Cbfbeta transcription complex for in
      vivo-suppressive function of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.
PG  - 609-20
AB  - Naturally arising regulatory T (Treg) cells express the transcription
      factor FoxP3, which critically controls the development and function of
      Treg cells. FoxP3 interacts with another transcription factor Runx1 (also
      known as AML1). Here, we showed that Treg cell-specific deficiency of
      Cbfbeta, a cofactor for all Runx proteins, or that of Runx1, but not
      Runx3, induced lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and
      hyperproduction of IgE. Cbfb-deleted Treg cells exhibited impaired
      suppressive function in vitro and in vivo, with altered gene expression
      profiles including attenuated expression of FoxP3 and high expression of
      interleukin-4. The Runx complex bound to more than 3000 gene loci in Treg
      cells, including the Foxp3 regulatory regions and the Il4 silencer. In
      addition, knockdown of RUNX1 showed that RUNX1 is required for the optimal
      regulation of FoxP3 expression in human T cells. Taken together, our
      results indicate that the Runx1-Cbfbeta heterodimer is indispensable for
      in vivo Treg cell function, in particular, suppressive activity and
      optimal expression of FoxP3.

TI  - Absence of leucine zipper in the natural FOXP3Delta2Delta7 isoform does
      not affect dimerization but abrogates suppressive capacity.
PG  - e6104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phenotype and function of regulatory T cells (Treg) largely
      depend on the presence of the transcription factor FOXP3. In contrast to
      mice, human Treg cells express isoforms of this protein. Besides the full
      length version (FOXP3fl), an isoform lacking the exon 2 (FOXP3Delta2) is
      co-expressed in comparable amounts. Recently, a third splice variant has
      been described that in addition to exon 2 also misses exon 7
      (FOXP3Delta2Delta7). Exon 7 encodes for a leucine zipper motif commonly
      used as structural dimerization element. Mutations in exon 7 have been
      linked to IPEX, a severe autoimmune disease suggested to be caused by
      impaired dimerization of the FOXP3 protein. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study
      shows that the lack of exon 7 does not affect (homo-) dimerization.
      Moreover, the interaction of FOXP3Delta2Delta7 to RUNX1, NFAT and NF-kB
      appeared to be unchanged in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and
      reporter gene assays, when compared to FOXP3fl and FOXP3Delta2.
      Nevertheless, retroviral transduction with FOXP3Delta2Delta7 failed to
      induce the typical Treg-associated phenotype. The expression of
      FOXP3-induced surface molecules such as CD25 and CTLA-4 were not enhanced
      in FOXP3Delta2Delta7 transduced CD4+ T cells, which also failed to exhibit
      any suppressive capacity. Notably, however, co-expression of FOXP3fl with
      FOXP3Delta2Delta7 resulted in a reduction of CD25 expression by a dominant
      negative effect. CONCLUSIONS: The leucine zipper of FOXP3 does not mediate
      dimerization or interaction with NFAT, NF-kB and RUNX1, but is
      indispensable for the characteristic phenotype and function in Treg cells.
      FOXP3Delta2Delta7 could play a role in regulating the function of the
      other FOXP3 isoforms and may be involved in cancer pathogenesis, as it is
      overexpressed by certain malignant cells.

TI  - Interactions among the transcription factors Runx1, RORgammat and Foxp3
      regulate the differentiation of interleukin 17-producing T cells.
PG  - 1297-306
AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of interleukin
      17-producing T helper cells (T(H)-17 cells) are still poorly understood.
      Here we show that optimal transcription of the gene encoding interleukin
      17 (Il17) required a 2-kilobase promoter and at least one conserved
      noncoding (enhancer) sequence, CNS-5. Both cis-regulatory elements
      contained regions that bound the transcription factors RORgammat and
      Runx1. Runx1 influenced T(H)-17 differentiation by inducing RORgammat
      expression and by binding to and acting together with RORgammat during
      Il17 transcription. However, Runx1 also interacts with the transcription
      factor Foxp3, and this interaction was necessary for the negative effect
      of Foxp3 on T(H)-17 differentiation. Thus, our data support a model in
      which the differential association of Runx1 with Foxp3 and with RORgammat
      regulates T(H)-17 differentiation.

TI  - FOXP3 actively represses transcription by recruiting the HAT/HDAC complex.
PG  - 1432-6
AB  - The Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) is a master cell lineage modulator in
      CD4(+)CD25(+) natural regulatory T cell (Treg) development. The Treg set
      of cells, also called T suppressor cells, play an essential role in
      natural Treg-mediated suppression of various types of immune cells.
      Suppression can be manifest by a cell-cell contact set of events, and
      recent evidence also supports soluble mediators. FOXP3 was previous
      identified as a passive transcriptional repressor which associates with
      nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, and
      calcineurin-dependent 2 (NFATc2) as well as several other transcriptional
      factors including nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) and acute myeloid
      leukemia 1(AML1)/runt-related transcription factor 1(RUNX1). We found
      FOXP3 could actively repress transcription by recruiting distinct histone
      acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases to function as a co-repressor
      complex. The identification of enzymatic factors operative as essential
      participants in FOXP3-mediated transcriptional repression provides a
      practical basis for therapeutically modulating the activity of FOXP3 in
      immune suppression. Here we briefly summarize recent progress in our
      understanding of the biochemistry of FOXP3-mediated transcriptional
      regulation.

TI  - Foxp3 controls regulatory T-cell function by interacting with AML1/Runx1.
PG  - 685-9
AB  - Naturally arising CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells (T(R) cells) are engaged in
      the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis by
      suppressing aberrant or excessive immune responses, such as autoimmune
      disease and allergy. T(R) cells specifically express the transcription
      factor Foxp3, a key regulator of T(R)-cell development and function.
      Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in conventional T cells is indeed sufficient
      to confer suppressive activity, repress the production of cytokines such
      as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and upregulate
      T(R)-cell-associated molecules such as CD25, cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, and glucocorticoid-induced
      TNF-receptor-family-related protein. However, the method by which Foxp3
      controls these molecular events has yet to be explained. Here we show that
      the transcription factor AML1 (acute myeloid leukaemia 1)/Runx1
      (Runt-related transcription factor 1), which is crucially required for
      normal haematopoiesis including thymic T-cell development, activates IL-2
      and IFN-gamma gene expression in conventional CD4+ T cells through binding
      to their respective promoters. In natural T(R) cells, Foxp3 interacts
      physically with AML1. Several lines of evidence support a model in which
      the interaction suppresses IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, upregulates
      T(R)-cell-associated molecules, and exerts suppressive activity. This
      transcriptional control of T(R)-cell function by an interaction between
      Foxp3 and AML1 can be exploited to control physiological and pathological
      T-cell-mediated immune responses.
